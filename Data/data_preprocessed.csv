update: few of you are asking my qualifications and skills.
an engineering graduate, i have experience in wordpress customization, logo design and content writing. apart from these, i do have video editing knowledge as well. so please suggest accordingly. previously i worked in a company which had data annotation work for ai( company lost the project, subsequently i lost my job). currently, i am learning web technologies like php, js.","lost my job, sick mother and paralysed dad, in this lockdown how to earn online?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g014wc/lost_my_job_sick_mother_and_paralysed_dad_in_this/," i'm a freelancer. don't listen to the idiots here. you can't freelance online as a beginner. that's a hard fact. no one will trust you with a job. i've been freelancing for years and i know what i'm talking about.

look for ngo's in your area and contact them one by one. definitely one of them will be able to help. also look for govt schemes. call your local municipality or corporation and talk to them. they are waiting to help. you can also start a crowdfunding campaign.

this is a crisis time. it's the correct time to lean on those around you. look for an opportunity to weather the lockdown and then slowly start looking for a job.

there are no magical ways to make money online if you aren't an expert. anyone who says otherwise is an idiot or a scammer. don't listen to them.

good luck op and take care. you'll get through this, remind yourself of that often. maybe you can add your skills to the post and someone could help you. hey, you can work as a video editor for the neso academy channel. he is currently looking for video editors. upvote for visibility! 

i'm sorry for you and hope you get some suggestions soon. it'd be helpful if you also mention what things you can do or maybe something like your qualifications. add yourself to fiverr and dm me your profile/username. i'll see if i can send some video editing work your way. everyone up vote this post.


lets help this fellow redditor mention your skill set. hey hey! if you are on facebook, please write a post on network capital, i’m sure many people will come forward and help you. additional to that, reach out to organisations working locally in your area and like someone said above, try and fill the gap in a disrupted supply chain. i’m not sure working for ngos right now would get you any money. it’s going to be volunteer work only. however you can try and write to centre for internet & society , explaining your situation and see if they can give you any paid work that you can do remotely. all the best ! really hope something works out for you. 

p.s you can reach out to this ngo called milaap , if you need help with some groceries and food. they would be happy to help you, they also run crowdfunding campaigns so if it’s really hard for you to find employment right now , i’m sure they’ll be able to help you in some way. i can probably help with some video editing work. can't promise anything but let's talk and figure. dmed you. send me your resume. i'll check if we have relevant openings for you in my company and refer you.", hashedram diabapp xataari Aashayrao sarcrastinator minchina_ota AlternativeDrop6 pythonapster wtfis09 zombie_singh06 pentacle555,lost job sick mother paralysed dad earn online hi really tough everyone recently lost job mom lever patient money saved already spent mother treatment tell earn money online money actually right suggest way paid asap thanks reading update asking qualifications skills engineering graduate experience wordpress customization logo design content writing apart these video editing knowledge well please suggest accordingly previously worked company data annotation work ai company lost project subsequently lost job currently learning web technologies php js
TWO-WHEELER-MAFIA,2020-04-09,AskIndia,205,646,False,"we have floods, terrorist attacks, famines due to lack of rain, pandemic etc. after every such incident we see the governemnt approaching us with a begging bowl (pm cares fund this time)

we pay so  much money as tax, be it on automobles, petrol, cigarettes, liquor, income tax, tax on electronics like laptops, mobile phones, toll on highways

bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during time of crisis. 

its not that they are providing pothole free roads, swift public transport, education or healthcare for that tax. fine - don't provide all these basic services but at least the government should not come with a begging bowl during each crisis!

the fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?",why does the government come with a begging bowl during every crisis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxofyu/why_does_the_government_come_with_a_begging_bowl/," i don't understand why they don't use money from contingency fund .. there's a separate fund called contingency fund 


>
contingency fund of india:
this fund is being held by the president of india. he can spend from this fund for emergency and unforeseen circumstances. no authorization from parliament is required,

public accounts of india:
1. bank savings account of the departments/ministries
2. national investment fund
3. national calamity & contingency fund (nccf)
4. national small savings fund, defence fund.¬¬
5. prarambhik shishak kosh, mnrega fund
6. provident fund, postal insurance etc. and so on
no permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account.

consolidated fund of india:
all the cash from direct and indirect taxes, all the loans that are taken by the government of india and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government. this is the largest of all three funds. the government needs parliament's approval to spend money from this fund
> the amount of money we pay as our taxes... they use it to gain goodwill for their parties(state or center) by freeing loans, water, electricity, transport and even their election campaigns. so in the time of actual needs, they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis. the govt of india (central govt.) runs a fiscal deficit every year. this means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise. note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs.

the goi doesn't earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to a multitude of factors. india has a large unorganised ""off the books"" sector which doesn't pay taxes, the indian state doesn't have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them, etc. this results in the only reliable revenue streams for the govt being salaried tax payers, gst collected and some other taxes. from this, gst payments have been less than projected because the govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post-gst.

now, a large chunk of the govt.'s expenditure goes into schemes for the ""upliftment of the poor"" and ""rural development"", etc etc. the problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself. by the 'state' i mean people who are a part of the state, ie: politicians and bureaucrats.

so taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism, to gain favour with the electorate so they're elected again, etc. a lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption. bureaucrats tasked with building 10 toilets might only build 2 and pocket the funds allocated for the other 8.

this is how taxpayer money in india is only used to serve politicians' and bureaucrats' interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society 'uplifted'.

there is no accountability and no transparency. potholed roads, slow public transport, namesake education and healthcare it's not a begging bowl. it's a psychological tactic, they know you'll donate when the country is going through a crisis ""even when we have enough money to handle the crisis"" and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks. 
>the fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?


because generations of people before you decided a spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our indian culture. now,those with spines exploit,and everyone spineless suffers. blame the populace.thats where all the govt employees come from. because if they have to give out from the government's kitty, it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot. india is poor - its a banal and boring answer but it is still true.

india needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels.

india needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure (non corrupt officers, people used to following the law - the habits of civilization)

our tax income isn't superb. our usage of money isn't super - we leak all over the place.

this means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during a crisis.

it also gives people a way to help - which is what most civilized people do. they feel bad when they see someone in trouble, and want to help, this is one way to do so. dont you ever question where your tax money goes. cant you see the tallest and most beautiful statue that has a natural cooling system whenever it rains, was built in india. which country provides this much comfort ? don't forget that 3000cr statue and 20,000cr rajpath renovation.

indianoogler,2020-04-06,AskIndia,214,260,False,"the corona virus has given me some time to think about my life choices a bit. i am 32, male and have decided not to get married. its not my thing. but i will be honest, i am worried about old age, not so much about loneliness but about sickness, weakness, inability to look after myself, financial support (i can still plan for this). in india, i think people still rely on their children to take care of them in their sunset years. i will take care of my parents until their last day. but i sometime wonder what will happen to me?

any body who have decided not to get married and have figured out their plans for old age?","men who are 30+ and have decided not to get married, what is your plan for old age?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvy95j/men_who_are_30_and_have_decided_not_to_get/," plan your finances. work and enjoy in your own ways when you are healthy. go see the world. then move to an assisted living apartments when you are retired from working. don't wait to become a cabbage to move to such living. make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there. am 37 and unmarried. i think my only fear is medical emergencies. 

rest all can be managed i think you are missing the point of marriage. 

it’s less to do with spousal/children support as you grow old, and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships. as a 65 year old, let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences i have had in my life. it has completed me. she is now 30plus, doing her own thing, in another country, and i certainly don’t expect her to come and stay and look after me when i am old and infirm. and i cannot but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter. 

my wife is my age, and we have now started the journey of looking after one another. when she was ill, i stayed by her side, and when i suffered a heart attack recently, she stayed by mine. and we keep fussing over each other. it’s called growing old together. 

but yes, i did plan financially for my older years, and those plans have more or less come to fruition. but that’s just a bonus. the main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships, although i will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems. but when you put everything on a scale, i would gladly go through all this again and again. 

so don’t look at marriage as a prop for your old age. that’s silly. look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships,  and going through the joys, the trials and the tribulations of parenthood. i am 31 and single. the point of marriage is not to find a woman who'll replace my mother. if that is the need then i'll get a nurse in old age or go to an old age home. 

unless i don't find a partner who has a similar mindset, has a personality of her own, is equally ambitious and will carry on in future even if i am not around, there is no point in saying yes to a random woman just for the sake of someone being there when i am old. 

i have seen couples who got married at 26 and have spent 4-5 years just quarreling and arguing on pety topics. people who didn't get a chance to understand each other before marriage and are now regretting. i don't want to live in such a marriage. 

my parents forced me into engineering and after two years i realised that this place is not for me. the argument that my parents used to send me to this engg college was that it will give you a well settled lifestyle and secure future. after a year i was suicidal. now if i get married because it is a guarantee to secure old age and not because i really like the girl (and she likes me back) then chances are that i (or both of us) will end up in a similar situation and i won't get an option like dropping out of this course without thinking of some serious repercussions. its crazy to me how many people in india look at marriage and kids as an ""investment for the future"" rather than the personal relationship they are supposed to be at the present. guess that's why arranged marriages and the pressure to marry is so common. its not so much a natural alignment of 2 people sharing their lives and more like a cold business transaction? its quite strange. hmm.. a lot of people have expressed their opinions.. as of me, i’m almost in the same boat as you.. my suggestion is to start saving and invest in ppf, fd & kvp. eat healthy and exercise.. when you’re old and single, go to a old age home.. shotgun to my face. that's my plan for, when i'm old. > not so much about loneliness

let me ask you a question. do you feel lonely now? do you have friends to hang out with frequently now? or someone really close to you?

you don't have to answer that here. that's for yourself.

the point is people get married because it gets lonely after a while. now i'm only 28 but i know for a fact that i can't live alone. if i could have a partner and not get married that's fine too. but people need stability, legal benefits and financial benefits. so most people prefer a marriage. not to mention that it has a social meaning to it.

> but i sometime wonder what will happen to me?

it's funny how you feel this already and yet thought of not getting married. the point of marriage is companionship. kids taking care of parents is such an old concept. let the kids live free. it's only the parents responsibility to groom them, guide them and let them find their way. you do that out of love not out of obligation.

and if you don't want that responsibility, don't have kids!

you and your partner will take care of each other. and you have to plan for the worst case anyway in case you become all alone.

hope you find your way. i plan to never get married. there are several reasons for it, failed marriage of my parents is one of them, but i just don’t know how to convince my parents. following are the challenges.

1) my mom always tell me what will society think, like am i gay or something. no i am not but if i don’t get married my parents will get embarrassed by this things

2) my parents said i will feel very alone and will get depressed when i will come home and there will be no one to welcome me. (like i am not already depressed haha)

3) our society just treats single men as a threat. how to handle that.

this is all i can think of right now, and i am really messed up to have any relationship ever. so option of getting married is off the table. just how to explain this to parents. future is here bro don't worry i'm 25 i decided not to get married even i told this to my parents
the best idea is savings then you can afford everything
in future, old age home and care is going to be a big business so don't worry i'm so relieved to see so many people in the same boat.

even i share the same fears about my sunset years..", RedDevil-84 congratsindia khushraho kingof-potatos USPrimeMinister jprbruce operation_vijay cheesz Unknown-path yadhavanyaddy acitity,men 30 decided married plan old age corona virus given think life choices bit 32 male decided married thing honest worried old age much loneliness sickness weakness inability look myself financial support still plan this think still rely children take care sunset years take care parents last day sometime wonder happen me body decided married figured plans old age
cataglottis,2020-04-13,AskIndia,139,130,False,"seems like everybody here is very critical of the direction india is heading towards. this makes me wonder, if money were to not be a thing anymore, how many people here would actually even live in india, if given the chance to be able to live anywhere in the world?","r/india: if money is no bar, would you prefer to stay in india or outside?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0igt7/rindia_if_money_is_no_bar_would_you_prefer_to/," if money is not a thing, i would choose india, but a hilltop castle in himachal i am an indian who lived in us for 7 years. i came back few months ago because of visa issues. i like staying in india with my family and friends but i would like to go back again one day. i feel like quality of life is way better in 1st world countries. i think people in india can have a good quality life but they put too many responsibilities on themselves , especially having more than one child. to answer your question most people who had a taste of living in 1st world countries will prefer to stay in those countries. that should tell you something about living outside india. this is my opinion , i like india as much as the next guy, i don’t mean to offend anyone. i live in europe and would like to come back to india. but, the same thing can't be said about my wife. unfortunately, women face lot of challenges in india - relatives and society in general are too intrusive in a woman's life. they get told how they should behave a lot. if money is no bar, i will make india like outside countries and stay here only.   **🥴** if money is no bar, i might not live any one place permanently. but given i must pick then no because i would rather pick somewhere clean air, water, no noise pollution, better security (law & order). tuscany, italy or greek islands sounds nice.

but on other hand, having so much money in india is living like king! but still i pick earlier as i won't like fame. moved to canada a year back. best decision i have made.

working for the same company with 10x the salary. wife got a job with 5x her indian salary. the healthcare is amazing, the government actually cares about its people, the people are very welcoming. 

the work culture is really good, no one works more than they are suppose to. there is no obligation of working more than whats assigned. leaves are earned not begged for.

my wife has been extremely happy here, there is not a single week where she does not mention that she cant believe she wasted so much of her life stuck in india. given the current situation and political landscape, i do not think we would be moving back anytime soon. india. 

a few small but important reasons: i am a small time business owner. i have managed to buy a house and have rented an office space that is just 10 mins from my house. traffic is a non issue for me.

besides this, i have 2 maids. one who cooks and one who cleans. (not right now, but usually.)

all of the above makes my day to day way better than most people i know who live abroad and have to do the cooking, cleaning etc them selves. not to mention the travel.

i live in a city where i have access to good infrastructure in terms of healthcare, malls, food etc. nothing to complain here too.

my whole cost of living right now as described above for me and my wife does not exceed 50,000 a month on most months. and we don't compromise on anything. thankfully neither of us has any interest in fancy cars or jewelry or stupidly costly phones.

living abroad access to all of this would be much more expensive.

besides the above, the only other material thing i want is to be able to travel to a nice place 2 times a year. that's also not super expensive for me. traveling more than that gets boring.

i don't want any more material things than this. so, i am super satisfied here and get everything i want at a very good rate.

the big thing i like about india however is the potential: the market size is massive. sell something of value to people, and i will max out my ambitions before i reach even 2% of the market.

about politics and religion etc: does not affect me. religion wise i am atheistic and if somebody shows up at my door and wants me to convert, i'll do it in a heartbeat. i don't have a lot of respect for my default religion so why not change it.

as for politics, i think it's a complex game. so, i don't have strong feeling about how this is right and that is wrong. i don't think i know enough to make those decisions. 

honestly in terms of politics i'm just grateful we don't have a insane guy like trump incharge. 

lastly, and this is a small thing: when ever i am outside india, i am always treated like an outsider or a tourist. only feel at home here where i know the language and look like the people.

so, lots of reasons to stay for me at least.

maybe others are no lucky and face different challenges. outside. if money not being a bar is a literal statement,then ideally in us with a eb5 green card, else either a fancy country like switzerland or an immigration friendly one like canada i just want a place with pleasant weather. i would leave the first chance i get no questions asked. money was not the reason i left. however, some the major reasons that pushed me to leave (conservative society, lack of freedom, lots of sexual harrasment) might probably not have been an issue if i was super rich and lived among other wealthy people.

also, i always had the itch to travel and explore different cultures. at 21, fresh out of college and coming from a middle class family, studying abroad was the only way i could live in another country. 

if money were no bar, i would probably keep traveling and living in different countries while also spending lots of time in india with family. i would not give up my citizenship unless i fall in love with another country/region and decide to settle there.", _azadak 1209naveen reti_opening Neglectedsince1994 kokishinkiba parth115 khoj_badami codingCoderCoding muhammad_sitaram lucifer666768 TheWallflower92,r money bar would prefer stay outside seems everybody critical direction heading towards makes wonder money thing anymore many would actually live given chance able live anywhere world
flaregunistaken,2020-04-08,AskIndia,182,122,False,"sorry for poor formatting i am on phone.


we(m22|f25) are in relationship from past three year.
we both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



we also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



things are going not as i supposed to go .


now she have changed her mind completely.


a brief background about her - she have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


even now she and her mother supports the family.


no one respects her family as they are poor.


she feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering indian society mentality.



now she refuse to marry me saying she would marry someone richer as i am also not in very good financial condition though i have a job in computer science field and i need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


she wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
she wants to rest and enjoy her life.


she said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


she can decide whom to marry or not and i can't put pressure on her to marry me.


she also told me that she don't want to be part of me when i am struggling.


she will marry me only if i get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both emi and lifestyle)


if she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

i asked her that i will try my best to give her best life but i need one year of support from her so that i can buy a house on emi but she ends up breaking up.

what should i do ?",she is leaving me because of me being poor what should i do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx29yh/she_is_leaving_me_because_of_me_being_poor_what/," she was your half girlfriend. picture is over, move on! buying a house at 23. 😳 what you should do is realize that she didn't love you for who you are, but your future job prospects and money. now that's said and done, move on! she will always want a guy who does better than her. this is the way of life man. i got screwed in a similar fashion. move on. ok what i'm about to say is super harsh. dude you invested way too much both emotionally and financially in a woman who doesn't give a fuck (clearly evident). it'll never workout even if she magically wakes up tomorrow morning and decided to become a sensible, caring woman. you're lucky cuz you get an exit option before shit fucks your life up. the classic reddit advice is applicable for you too ( to a certain extent) : lawyer up, delete facebook and hit the gym. you dodged a bullet bro. move on. op forget her and move on. you should be glad she left you before there is any marriage or kids involved. her point of view is valid. a man, or a woman, can walk out of a relationship anytime they want. even without an explanation. they have the right to do that.

considering her background, it is entirely understandable that she wants to have a life of no worries. you might feel the same in her situation. 

if she actually marries you, chances are the discontent would always remain. and that will be very bad for your marriage. you would know her discontent even if she hides it, and you would not trust her completely, ever.

drop it. for your own peace of mind. you two are not compatible. compatibility is about having great emotional as well as ideological connect, connect on how to handle life etc. you two do not have that.

none of this is your fault. its not hers either. you two have different ideas of life. and as someone married 18 years, let me tell you that having different ideas of what life should be is a marriage breaker. do not regret this.

you do your thing, try harder, make a life of your own. someone who is more suitable would turn up, someone who who feels and thinks like you. well.

how old are you?

22?
you'll be fine.

if she was in for money, i'd say good riddance. pity the man she ends up with tho.

- what exactly are you doing with pm cares fund? what is the progress?
- what is your plan to provide sufficient ppe kits to medical staff and doctors? by when? 
- what is india's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?
- what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?
- what is the update on scaling up testing of covid-19 cases?
- china built hospitals within days. have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?

i know pm wouldn't have exact answers to above questions. it's tough time. but he can atleast provide an update on these more critical questions in his video, rather than just praising public and asking them to do stupid things. honestly, even i could do that. 

secondly, this pm has no guts to hold press conference. even trump is answering to reporters. then why pm modi can't? why he choose to hide and talk from behind the screen only?

----------------------------------
**play bella ciao 5th apr @ 9pm**


let's not worship our leaders blindly without any logic. let's have sympathy for healthcare workers and the police who are on the ground risking their lives. clapping and lighting candles is stupid. the open questions up till now that have not been answered by any govt authority are:

what exactly are you doing with pm cares fund? what is the progress?

what is your plan to provide sufficient ppe kits to medical staff and doctors? by when?

what is india's plan to develop a vaccine for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?

what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?

what is the update on scaling up testing of covid-19 cases?

china built hospitals within days. have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?


our pm has no guts to hold a press conference. even trump is answering to reporters, then why can't pm modi?

---------------------------------- my family will keep on using the lights and fans normally. i for one, am planning to play f1 2019 on my pc lol modi is cercei. absolutely no plans for the night king. > what is your plan to provide sufficient ppe kits to medical staff and doctors? by when?   
>  
> what is the update on scaling up testing of covid-19 cases? 

just answering these two will assure majority of the population. unfortunately, our leader's priority lies elsewhere. i'm gonna join this good cause.
i'll roll grass and i also have some wine left at my place.
and exactly when the song is over. i'll switch my account to the porn account. i'm gonna play beethovens ode to joy on loud ,alle menschen werden brüder... >	i know the neighbors won't understand what's it and i am safe.

the whole point of protest is to let the world know what you stand for. why do you need to hide it from your neighbors? ye mera plan chori karta hai

/s gandia ne ye achha nai kiya . be careful, your neighbours might harass you for that. just like the national anthem brigade i never liked the overhyped activities of our over active pm. taali bhajao itself was an idiotic action if you ask me. nicely summed up. i will just go around as everyday. that’s the plan here", AnonymousSeeker5 TablePrime69 faceofnobody noobdoto sardikhasi Notsogoldencompany svpvv Communism_Bad SkewRadial thedesijoker joystickjango,plan 5th april 9pm switch lights play bella ciao song what plan worship leaders without logic sympathy health workers doctors police feel thali bajao clapping ok not ok me lighting torch stupid want convey govt pm stop fooling best society best interests unprepared unplanned make videos want answers critical issues exactly pm cares fund progress plan provide sufficient ppe kits medical staff doctors when plan develop cure covid 19 see outcome what economy plan fix covid 19 controlled update scaling testing covid 19 cases china built hospitals within days done anything alternative quarantine know pm exact answers questions tough atleast provide update critical questions video rather praising public asking stupid things honestly could that secondly pm guts hold press conference trump answering reporters pm modi can t choose hide talk behind screen only that arrived plan keep lights play bella ciao know neighbors understand what safe edit note plan originally suggested another user comment another thread subreddit forgetting username friends going follow plan now edit 2 user u communism_bad gave plan first
wordswithmagic,2020-04-03,AskIndia,76,152,False,"the doctor says that he is 100% sure that the virus is spreading via vegetables, as well, and he has turned full paranoid.

this is what they are doing:

- after buying raw vegetables, they keep it outside their home for 72 hours

- after 72 hours, they wash each and every piece of vegetable, even lemons and chilies with soap water, then cold water, then hot water

- after that, they keep it in the fridge or cook them

my friend is worried, as her husband wont listen to the arguments that soap can be harmful for the vegetables. they have a little kid as well. 

my question:

- is washing vegetables with soap ok?

- how to convince that doctor to stop this, if his method is not safe?

- how can we ensure that the vegetables are virus-free? 

suggestions, insights would be appreciated.","[serious] my friend's doctor husband has become paranoid. he is washing every vegetable with soap, and my friend is very worried.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu3f8b/serious_my_friends_doctor_husband_has_become/," 1.  a [research study from 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs12560-013-9114-4)  on coronavirus in strawberries and lettuce found that the virus only survives on produce between four and 10 days, which is much lower than other respiratory viruses.
2.  this [article](https://www.firstpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-follow-these-steps-to-maintain-hygiene-while-handling-fruits-vegetables-at-market-and-home-8194051.html) tells a bit about washing vegetables.

4. can covid-19 be passed on through food?  
no reported cases of covid-19 have been linked to contamination of  food.  the main risk of transmission is from close contact with infected  people. the advice to food businesses and consumers is to maintain good  hygiene practices and to wash your hands regularly. thorough cooking  will kill the virus.

says this [fsai website](https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html) take doctor to a different doctor. how to solve the following problem:  
1. vegetable vendor has a bunch of bananas in the stall  
2. customer who has the virus visits the shop to buy something else, sneezes.  
3. droplets fall on bananas  
4. you visit the stall half an hour later, pick up the bananas  
5. you come home, wash your hands (but bananas still have viral particles on them)  
6. you wash the bananas with plain water, but plain water does not destroy virus, bananas still have virus on them  
7. your dad picks up a banana and eats it, now virus is on your dad's hands  
8. all your dad needs to do now is to touch his nose there are special soaps to wash fruits and vegetables. i’ve seen them in indian stores like dorabjees in pune. can't heat not kill it? what the fuck is this virus? we boil vegetables before consuming. show your friend this video. explains a good bit on how to sterelise your groceries.

1. yes, washing vegetables is okay, just rinse it with clean water so that no soap remains. if you don't do that and put the vegetables straight to fridge, your fridge becomes contaminated with virus if the vegetables had that. and virus lives for a long time in fridge. treat everything which you bring from outside as door knobs, except your doorknob is fixed but let's say you bring the veggies and keep them on table and maybe even wash your hands,but they still are sitting there on the surface right? cleaning them with any detergent based solution might not be good in the long run but surely the focus isn't that right now i think he is sensible. given the fact that there is no way around the virus when you get stuff from outisde, its important to decontaminate. soap is best, for now. the only other option is to take the risk of getting infected. choose one option. personally i think the doctor is right.", Neglectedsince1994 None adga4907 hipsydoodle fatterthanawhale Dialup1991 satyasys mrehanms termi05 shahu95 budbuk,serious friend doctor husband become paranoid washing every vegetable soap friend worried doctor says 100 sure virus spreading via vegetables well turned full paranoid doing buying raw vegetables keep outside home 72 hours 72 hours wash every piece vegetable lemons chilies soap water cold water hot water that keep fridge cook friend worried husband wont listen arguments soap harmful vegetables little kid well question washing vegetables soap ok convince doctor stop this method safe ensure vegetables virus free suggestions insights would appreciated

what are my options!?

i've been in your situation and i said the same thing and then i did it.

i left home and moved in with my friends. i worked in a call center for 18k and lived on that. that was almost ten years ago. you are already earning. leave. it was the best decision of my life. get the f out of your home. get a job, earn money, live and stop depending on your parents for money. my dad used to be exactly like this until i started earning. he hasn’t yelled at me or disrespected me ever since. i think if you root towards financial freedom only then you will be respected by your parents. 1. get a job or start your own business if you are interested in that family business & use those contacts.
2. get out of that house when done with step 1. you have bachelor's degree...if lockdown wasn't there i would have advised you to join any bpo. you can learn a new language. take a foreign language teaching certification course so you can teach in schools or in colleges. 

p.s-  just  a dumb suggestion. i dont know anything about the field. take this with grain of salt : try to be physically stronger, join a gym. you are 25. you can become intimidating with some muscle. in indian society physical abuse is prevalent. not saying you should stay with your father. but being physically and mentally stronger will make life easier at home and outside. are you being physically abused? you say that you make 20-30k by yourself doing some remote work apart from working in your family business.

isn't that 20-30k enough, in your city, to live independently? for instance, there are hostel services available where you pay a fixed amount and get shared accommodation and food in return. such facilities are generally used by employees who work away from home. what type of business are you in? maybe finding jobs in the same field will be easier. 1. save as much as you can for the next few months. 
2. if you are interested in government jobs and feel you have a good chance, prepare for any of those jobs. don't think upsc. there are also several state govt jobs.
3. another possibility is a teaching job at schools. (you need to complete a 1 year b.ed degree), but if your father supports it or if you have enough money, you can try this option.
4. another avenue: call center jobs mainly require fluency in english and general common sense. 
5. if cooking interests you, somehow join a hotel as a kitchen assistant (right now hotel industry is bust, but after a few months) and climb your way up the ladder.
6. if you are ready to invest more time & energy, programming is a good field although it may take anywhere between 1-2 years to become good enough to start applying for jobs.
7. if you communicate well, sales & marketing is another field you can try your hands on. since you have completed a bachelor's in mass media, you can try out options like digital marketing. build your portfolio accordingly.

&#x200b;

there are several more possibilities. just look around yourselves & see which jobs are easy for you to jump on to. see if you have friends or acquaintances who can guide you / refer you for a particular job opening. in the worst case if you don't have anyone on your network, reddit is always there. good luck :)", sterlingcorp HairLikeWinterFire parth95s Neglectedsince1994 Dapper-Communication dunkarood baba_ji_ki_booti Bob_11 IdeasRealizer iamuniquefe IamGroot_19,cant take father physical abuse anymore independent 25 years old guy father abused hit me work family business wanna toxicity cant take anymore feel killing ending misery bachelors degree mass media othe work experience options genuinely looking worthy advice regards making carrer getting house good d rather stay small hut stay suffer abuse every months options edit make 20 30k per month remote work make ends meet looking something support long term patient suffered long probably suffer onto something that price willing pay
PM_ME_YOUR_UPI,2020-02-23,AskIndia,483,470,False,"got married last month, arranged marriage but had long courtship and both fell in love, honeymoon was sex less. in courtship period she used to kiss but now she absolutely doesn't want to kiss. i haven't seen her naked. what to expect don't know. i love her.

so please keep this fact in mind when you offer your overly optimistic piece of advice. [this could be you. just make sure. ](https://youtu.be/t44whlhx7yo) there could a broad set of reasons, man. you need to be the one to find out by talking to her.
the following are some dumb things off the top of head

1. whenever sex comes up she might get reminded about old relationship or something.

2. she might not be interested in you. i am sorry to say this but yes.

3. childhood trauma idk seen her parents doing that or worse

4. she might be asexual, who are not interested in sex at all. it's normal but it's worse for a partner who is obviously not. (todd from bojack horseman)

look you need to talk to her. you need to tell her you want to have sex, and that is a fucking deal breaker for you. 

and can i ask you something, you talked about long courtship, did you both not talk about sex? story time. a family friend (guy) got married (arranged marriage) and his wife wouldn't have sex with him. he tried to communicate with her and she openly said that she can't have sex but can be a good partner.

i don't know the details but the guy divorced her on these grounds. and telling the family the exact reason and not beating around the bush.

nobody saw a fault in that. most people need sex in their life. some save it till marriage, some explore before that. but if sex is important to you, then it is important. period.

you don't have to be a fucking pussy about it. try to tell her in the most direct way what you feel. if she even gives a rat's ass about saving this marriage (and love you enough) she would at least open up and tell her feelings.

if it doesn't work out, get a divorce. there isn't one single true love. that shit is bullshit. you'll fall in love again. is she like collecting dragon balls to rezurrect her ex ? does she love you?

if yes, just sit down with her and ask her what is stopping her from doing what needs to be done.

all employees have laptops and they can smoothly work from home. there is a need of change in mindset. every day you come home from office with a thought that i might have cought this thing. my employer gave us a choice and while most took it, a few of us (the top management, and the leadership) are trying our best to keep the lights running. because if the business fails (we're a product company) then the economic turmoil will ruin more of our employees in the long run. so, we're still going to office in turns with ample precautions. it's the least we can do until things escalate beyond control. may god have mercy on us all.

a mentality of self obsession ( selfies, social media, tik tok, filters, etc.,) and i am right mentality is on the rise. we no longer have healthy discussions or debates. it's all about who one-ups another. it is cool to be a leftist and align with popular opinions because all we want is to fit in. the bragging culture on social media to get the most likes and fomo has bought a ton of mental health issues among people. apart from all this, we are all suffering from sympathy fatigue (too much to care for in the world right now). so it's not just india, all over the world it's the same. i am enjoying discount on chicken most indians don't learn critical thinking in schools. one of my science teachers was extremely explicit regarding this. she said very clearly that we shouldn't believe what you read or hear unless you can find proof, even if it is her own subject.

this is why i don't actually curb people like flat earthers from the get go. most are gone too far and are in same category as bhakts... but on 9 gag a few years ago i found a few who i think were just kids and actually wanted to know if the earth was flat or not. sent them few links and videos and experiments and they realized it's all just a dumb belief.

if we start teaching the kids logical thinking, reasoning and evidence based thought process, maybe there's a good future for this country even parenting and teaching can counter the best genes. and we have petty tyrants for parents and greedy fools for teachers. what do you expect. give it some time. internet culture is fairly new to india and hence the chaos. people are gonna believe in everything they see on the internet until they lose trust in many sources they read or hear online. don't blame genetics for our stupidity. this phenomenon is called whatsapp university. in india data is cheaper than food and employment is scarce so there is a sizeable chunk of the young generation who are deprived of good education have access to unlimited data and whatever they gets in whatsapp they think thats true and they are learning something new. no one told them that there is something called fact checking and then there is it cell who will spread propaganda with fake photos videos etc. things that you see with your eyes are very hard to ignore unless there is awareness about factchecking, that videos can be faked photos can be doctored. worse days are coming when indian political parties starts using deepfakes. i don’t want to sound like i’m giving you some gyaan (although i know it will so i apologise) but to each his own man. you do you and they do that. if you’re gonna sit and worry about stupid people and the things they get fooled by, then you’re gonna have 135 crore different reasons to ruin your mood and life’s too short to sit and worry about things that don’t involve your own happiness. आओ प्यार करें। a society that thinks cow feces and urine are 'magic' can believe anything.", notanothervoice shisku Shayan_The_Stunter vpsj 10point6lakhpermonth Naryu_ Dumma1729 cshaibal wonderbruvski SabBarabar iSalaamU,recessive stupid gene going blindly believe every stupid message comes along app instant grams tik tok known dum dum become big stupid believe coronavirus spreads chicken would coronavirus someone coughing million times faint hint getting cooked meat poultry business went shit ended burying live chicks baby chickens life valued country herd mentality prevails sane sometimes wish born

edit:


it is byjus jo parents ka khoon choos rhi hai. 


apart from this like byjus every other edutech startup is shit in my opinion because education should be free i met this guy at bangalore airport, i don't remember exactly why he came, i think it was to start a section on the website for indian students studying in government schools or something of that sorts. he was so cool and very friendly i'll tell you my story from when i was in 12th grade.

my entire pre-high school life i was very good at math, just naturally good at grasping new mathematical concepts and enjoyed it quite a bit.

during 11th grade, i was barely studying anything, i had taken pcm and i would be gaming the entire day cause i had just got a new pc. this led to me being completely clueless about calculus to the point where even the most basic differentiation concepts seemed incomprehensible to me.

i remember shitting myself out of fear for my oncoming boards cause i literally couldn't solve a single differentiation sum, let alone the rest of calculus. (i was in isc and it was december)

one of my friends lent me his pace account and i watched video lectures but i didn't understand them either. then, i found out about khan academy and watched his video about implicit differentiation (y = arcsinx) and a couple more and this was the first time my parents had seen me intently looking forward to math like i did as a kid in middle school.

sataniscraycray,2020-04-14,AskIndia,37,72,False,"i was out to get some meds for my mentally and physically handicapped niece. to my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, i was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what i was doing outside, to which i stated my reason and then was asked why i was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. i was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, i decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

i can't help but rationlize why i was struck. my friend says that i was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. he then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (my friend btw, is indian and lives in a middle eastern country). was it right for the cop to strike me? i can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe i should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. what do you guys think?

edit: thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what i had gone through. i didn't mention this but, i am sort of new to india, i came here like last year to complete my ug, so i didn't take into account that the indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where i was raised (i.e, middle east). i admit that i was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, i don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering i showed him proof of reason as to why i was outside in the first place. 

neither do i think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as i think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. as far as i've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but i shouldn't judge them individually based on what i may have heard but i cannot deny what i've heard or read anyway.",got struck by a cop today,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ybrw/got_struck_by_a_cop_today/," 1. you should have worn a mask
2. it was wrong for the cop to hit you maybe it is mandatory to wear a mask in your state dude. you should have worn a mask, before going out. it's different in other countries but we are not new here. also, if not there you would have gone to thee pharmacy where the people could have also complained. copper doesn’t know who you are. for him, you are the average joe loitering in the streets. and he treated you like one. you should have worn the mask. 

he shouldn't have ideally hit you, ideally. unfortunately the cops have had to resort to these methods as they have to behave in manners which appeal to the lowest common denominators in the society, unfortunately. inspite of all the efforts made to educate people, there are some who still ignore all warnings, or go out without masks. mask pehen le lode 

nahi to gand pe padenge sote police have got no authority to use excessive force unless you are threatening the safety and good order of the society. in this case you weren't. their action isn't reasonable nor justified.

but we take their power abuse so much for granted that it feels normal. you can't imagine such police brutality in developed nations. it's not at all normal and they bloody should be reprimanded for that. it is illegal for a police to beat even a person who is arrested and is kept in police custody by a court, let alone a person for *making a mistake(your case)* or breaking a law.

even your parents don't have a right to beat you.

i think it's just a cultural thing. those we are taught to respect also think that is okay for them to beat us *on the pretext of disciplining us*. for example, parents think that it is okay to beat their children, teachers -> students, police -> citizens, politicians -> govt workers(i.e. police and others). sometimes, with children, it even transcends immediate family, and siblings of parents also beat the children.

i think that it should be taught that respect goes both ways. students respect teachers, and converse *must* also be true. in simple terms, every person must respect others regardless of their age, relationship, profession, etc. one doesn't need fancy words, while talking with kids, to show that they respect them, because, just the tone of their speech can.

as i learnt from reddit, *be excellent to each other*. you are lucky you have not been sexually assaulted. my sister was teased by cops and she was scared that she would get raped. what type of tattoo you had imprinted if your reason to go outside was not legit, i would understand this obviously. but tbf no one should use force or violence to make a point. it was totally wrong for the cop to hit you even after your reason to go out was legit. everyone forgets , its human tendency. doesnt mean someone hits you and takes you to court for it.

people around the world should realize that and just stop exerting force and creating violence everywhere they go. > i can't help but rationlize why i was struck.

throwaway841009,2020-04-11,AskIndia,29,85,False,"well, as much as i hate doing things which are cliches - seems like this cliche worked in my favor. we had been trying for the past year or so but the lockdown kinds of sealed the deal. 

&#x200b;

so, i have some pretty noob questions. 

&#x200b;

1) any extra precautions that i need to take with respect to covid-19

&#x200b;

2) when should one start getting emotionally attached to the \*thing\*? i mean - i don't want to be disappointed in case of a miscarriage / other complications. i am actively avoiding calling it a \*baby\* so as to not to form a bond. 

&#x200b;

3) any specific stuff that i need to procure during the lockdown? (i am in rajasthan where it has been extended till may 1st). 

&#x200b;

a funny story to add: when my wife told me about that she missed her period - i was in my bathroom smoking a joint. i was so scared / surprised - i told her i was shitting and we should talk later.",help wanted - just found out my wife is pregnant for the first time!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fyx2y9/help_wanted_just_found_out_my_wife_is_pregnant/," you should name the kid corona. and then when they're in school, you could scream 'go corona go' at them during sports day. 

sorry. runaway thought. congratulations! i’m pregnant myself and here are some of the tips:
1. meet or talk to your wife’s obgyn asap. if she’s not already on pre natal vitamins she needs to get some now. you need to stop smoking around her and stop smoking completely if you can
2. how have you confirmed the pregnancy? have you done a home test? you’ll need to get an ultrasound sound 5-6 weeks, if you hear the heartbeat the chances of your having a baby are pretty high. you can tell your immediate relatives (parents etc) then. for friends and extended family, you can wait till the early analogy anomaly scan at 12 weeks. 
3. isolate her as much as possible. nausea and fatigue will soon kick in so be prepared to take on all household chores from her. in any case, she has to avoid outside contact as much as possible. 
4. buy some good pregnancy books and start reading. 1) wash hands often 
2) wait at-least until week 9/10 before you announce or get attached- that’s what my ob said
3) make sure there’s enough ice cream or some of her favorite foods in freezer.. the nausea starts around week 7

congratulations and all the best wishes! about 2: even i did the same. even after my daughter was born, i was scared of sids and started calling her ‘it’ a few times by mistake. only later on i realised my folly... it’s all in our head man. get attached, nothing will happen. revel in the joy. forget about statistics. throughout entire pregnancy and your child’s future, there will be multiple scares. 1. stay in separate rooms
2. ask her to wash hands with sanitiser as often as she can
3. wear masks and hand gloves when you go out
4. when you come back, change clothes, wash hand, take bath if possible
5. stop smoking joints
6. move out of cities in  rajasthan  when possible https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/

बधाईयाँ ! some answers to ur questions...
1. a bit late for any precautions... lol.. kidding... keep your wife indoors and make sure she doesn't get exposed to unnecessary risks.. you too and whoever else is around.. consult ur doc whenever things improve.. 
2. stop thinking negative shit... start loving it now and when your heart and soul want to..
3. don't think you need anything for now but that will change.. fast...
4. be grateful, give the lord thanks and good luck! i will give a detailed answer by eod today. if it skips my mind, please give me a reminder name him/her sensibly. don't make the name too long. all the best man. looks like working from home has been really productive for you.

if you can't see a doctor, start taking folic acid. 0. avoid/give up smoking of any kind
1. check with a physician. not enough study out there to say how coronavirus affects fetal development, but a doctor may be able to guide you
2. first trimester is when majority of miscarriages take place. not saying it doesn’t happen later, but do wait to tell others until beginning of second trimester. in my case, i did not feel a bond until my baby was 2 months old - i am the father
3. fresh healthy food, multi-vitamins to begin with and looser fitting clothes and supporting pillows in later months. also read the pregnancy literature like - what to expect and any other books out there, but keep in mind every pregnancy is different and you may have a unique experience. having knowledge is good, but don’t panic if nothing is “going as per the book”
4. look up a good gynae and take her for appointments . she will need the first ultrasound to confirm pregnancy and thereafter to monitor fetal development.", knowtoomuchtobehappy mum_mom nam558881456 FtothepowerofF satyasys SabBarabar cumbhakt hrishidev dlisfyn JinKazamaWins ForthCrusader,help wanted found wife pregnant first well much hate things cliches seems cliche worked favor trying past year kinds sealed deal x200b so pretty noob questions x200b extra precautions need take respect covid 19 x200b 2 start getting emotionally attached thing mean want disappointed case miscarriage complications actively avoiding calling baby form bond x200b 3 specific stuff need procure rajasthan extended till may 1st x200b funny story add wife told missed period bathroom smoking joint scared surprised told shitting talk later

also, suppose you're a polyglot, hence you're proficient in all languages and interacting with people are your forte, where would you migrate to? would you consider staying in india itself? what do you plan on doing for a livelihood in the new city?",what would you do if you possess a crore worth of inr and want a higher standard of living.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwi2ei/what_would_you_do_if_you_possess_a_crore_worth_of/," move to tier 2 city with a low pollution index. since internet and flight connectivity is pretty good even in tier 2 cities you can earn enough from a small business or freelancing. raise horses on a farm in a hill station. 1 cr inr isn't much change country xd a crore is hopelessly inadequate to obtain citizenship by investment for any country worth its salt. the best bet is to stay in india. head or the mountains. find a small town, even a village, and take a small house with garden space on rent. grow as much as you can, and manage the rest. with the interest you earn from the one crore, you should be able to handle your life. switzerland , the question is will they accept you?

if i have only less than 7 crores, which is peanuts if you want to live in foreign coutnires, i would buy some land here in kerala and retire.  i will be sacrificing on modern lifestyle but would gladly go for the peaceful lifestyle. if  i get bored i would stay in mumbai or bangalore for a short while to spice  things up a bit.

if i am a multi-millionaire , i would fucking get out of here, buy citizenship of an european country and try to further make money out of my hobbies since i would have good peers and environment in such first world countries. infact one of my relative already accomplished this, he became a millionaire through real estate by selling land in kerala, got job in canada and settled there,  knowing full well that he can retire any moment since he has enough money to sustain himself. if i had right now split the amount into some property, medium to high risk mutual funds. i would just pump into shares many have fallen. i would move out of india, it will be crowded in the future probably too commercialized for my liking

hard work but pay is tax free and col is cheap i won't move to a tire 2 city. 
i'll move to the cheapest town to the big metro. even if it's 100 km.

invest in a farm land a bit away from there i'll need atleast 3-5 acres in 50 lakhs including paperwork and registery. i'll use contract farm labour here.

then i'll buy a small parcel of land about 150 - 200 sq. yards on the main highway road. should not be more than 20000/sq.yard. 40 lakhs budget done here.

take the 10 lakhs, use it for seed investment for organic farming/not the certificate waale those are expensive to attain but the traditional indian way using natural prey of insects for pest control and rent a house. it'll last me a while.

humanity/society/culture thrives on trade. always has. you are welcome. go for it, as much as i know my people, they would love it! it's a thing to be happy about.
if someone else is trying to be a part of your culture/ tradition for sometime by wearing the cultures clothing ( regardless of the gender)..it means  you have got a good culture and there is nothing to get mad about it.

in a way it make me think why i myself am so averse to wear clothing from my own culture and why i feel embarrassed ...( not a saree) but something like a dhoti kurta with a cap like [here](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-group-of-elderly-indian-men-sitting-on-seat-in-traditional-white-dress-47788260.html)

all the best you sound sincere so please don't take this the wrong way: you will not be able to earn much at this stage in life. data entry is barely a job, and it takes up hours for little pay. instead, find an area that you can build passion for and is economically rewarding. study your ass off, and help your sister through college. if your relatives are kind enough to pay for your college and her schooling, let them. reward their faith by being an amazing student. good luck. how are your technical skills?   
could you please dm me a link to your resume?   
i could try hiring you for some quality assurance work.   


take care mate!  
i hope things turn out better for you and your family. all right my friend, how can i help? could you please pm me your skills and past experience, if any. i'll try to give it my best shot. if nothing else, i may be able to nudge you in the right direction buddy. do you have interest in content writing? i can suggest you something if yes. if there's a mcdonald's branch around, you can ask them for one. crew jobs are usually based on shifts. you can work any shift you are comfortable with ( if they're looking to hire). also, it doesn't pay very bad either. i have a friend who attends college in the afternoon and works a night shift at the restaurant. a full time work can pay you upto 8 to 9k. they also offer meal allowance. also if the place is looking to hire, they'll let you join in asap. you can ask in multiple branches whichever nearer to you. likewise burger king and dominos. the job might involve serving and cleaning, but if you take it in a positive way, you won't have a problem with it. let me know how your search goes :-) i  hope for the 4 u. unfortunately im a kid n i cant help. but best of luck to u, friend.

curiouspupil,2020-04-08,AskIndia,104,5,False,"note: i am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

a little background: i am a bit on the introverted spectrum, i live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). my parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, i am now 29). i always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. and, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). i understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still i thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). even if they did have, i thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). but, wow!, was i totally wrong. it appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**i came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people i know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from quora. to my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that i shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). when asked if i can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

i still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am i to judge how should one live. but when i asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, i could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). i for one cannot understand this. **it appears i am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person i am going to share my life with did things with someone else. i am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something i can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**my questions are -**

1. am i the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? i am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe i didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. if i am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am i just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that i am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and i am just being paranoid?
4. why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

please dont label me as backward/prudish, i am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and i believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and i am not mysogynist either. just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

and sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200b;

ps:

by intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

and i am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again i might be wrong(i am happy to stand corrected)

its not because i wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so i dont want my partner to have what i couldn't. that would only makes me a hypocrite. (i am not a stud nor attractive, i didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations i have on my partner)

and no judgement at all, i practice live and let live(if it sounded so, i didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). i just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.","are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/," you are almost 30 years old, which is probably more than 1/3 of your life. expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. there is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. in these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain 'pure' or 'sanskari'. and if you think of it, terms like 'honry', 'dirty' will make way to pious usages like 'love making' for describing sex once marriage is done.

personally, my future partner's past won't affect me as long as it won't cause any problem with our future. i also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together. here it goes. 

1. men who have sex are not pigs. sex isn't dirty, it's just sex. there's no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. 

2. sex is not correlated with honour. looking at women as honourable just because she's never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. 

3. sex is fun. it's nice. it feels good. there you go. girls get horny too, you know. it's not just you who's been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. 

4. what bullshit is this partners first and last ? are y'll objects and properties owning each other ? sex is just sex, it's fun it's nice. you can compare it to watching movies. the only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. 

and this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life i've been privileged enough to meet some girls i've been able to love. there's no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. people do exist polygamous relationships. sex is just sex. there's nothing more to it, character, this, that. nothing. 

5. why does it mean so much to you ? maybe you've spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that's not what everyone does. more than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? why does your morality have to be overriding ? 

don't blame others for the image of life you've created in your own head. 



do try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with sex ? i'll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman's value lies in her vagina. if it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. why this ?!


if there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who's name the girl won't even remember. is this still a thing? i did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. so yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family. i am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.

1. not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. even most is generalization.

2. sex is not at all associated with honour.

3. sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. for some it is casual and physical. for some it is emotional.

4. nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.

5.  you are not the only one who thinks like that. if you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. but demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.

6. if previous relationship doesn't bother the current relationship then it shouldn't be a cause of worry. and i am personally fine with that. lmao what the fuck is this post i think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic indian trope. fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. it’s funny. sounds like an oxymoron. 

anyway, as to your question. having a past isn’t a deal breaker. you had relationships. it doesn’t make a difference. what matters is what is the current situation. are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. blah blah. these things matter more than sexual past. 

and honestly, look for a person you’re compatible with. 

society seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. but it is not so. a girl’s honor is not in her pants. we all need to understand that. 

if you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship. if you haven't had any relationships, it's perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn't.

i'll be downvoted here, but as long as you're not a hypocrite, you're allowed to have your preferences.

\>when asked if i can at least ask the girl upfront

i don't know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don't have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn't. if she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn't want to reveal anything.

also, from what i've heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn't even if they did have bfs. people have preferences, you have one. if you are not a hypocrite, it's fine. 

don't ask her on the first meeting. maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she's comfortable with you. 

tell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. she'll reject you if she's had some partners. op more concerned if you can see the number 90 on your keyboard than being a virgin at 30. so many parentheses those 2 numbers are faded out, no? speaking for myself, she will be my equal. i'll be okay with her history if she's okay with mine. i had similar thoughts. i was 29 then. virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from govt school in a tier 2 town, not much english skills and an average looking guy. after i got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, i told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an mnc , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. we got engaged and then wedding and after a week i looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. i didnt care much at first. but i asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. i didnt tell her i saw her emails though.  


fastforward a couple of weeks, i further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old fb chats and i learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. i had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. i confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. things went only south from here. because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only ""friendly"" she claimed.  


i still trusted her but things did not end good for us. i could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. but she is smart. it has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. a part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. i still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/wife? i believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past. it will destroy everyone's lives.", HerculePorotta OneLoki no_duh_sherlock ThanosMadeSense dratonius hokagesamatobirama krauser76 Shellynoire miguser TheAshwin JazzlikeWorldliness5,especially men really okay partner past history boyfriends sexual afraid labelled backward prudish want fit in with liberals pseudo liberals note saying apply women applies men you reverse genders below right women need worry husbands past they should little background bit introverted spectrum live little bubble not much contact info goes around especially lives trends currently parents searching brides arranged marriage 29 always thought guys not all most pigs would ready drop pants without serious commitments and girls keep honor sex marriage serious commitment understand parents may case currently still thought least good number girls never go casual relatiionships boyfriends with intimacy involved have thought would validation among peers and would never intimacy but wow totally wrong appears girls especially metros definetely would least two boyfriends with serious commitment mind ready wanting intimacy came conclusion little research got curious paranoid too asked around know men women homely next door girl types they read articles answers quora surprise single wanted oppose think wrong e okay casual relatiionships boyfriends with intimacy involved need wait someone special without getting intimate savor joy partner first last and partner first last nodded admirable great didnt give much importance said shouldnt that and shouldnt expect so hey practical man way you cant way asked least ask girl upfront in polite non condescending non judgemental way reply always no cant ask that partner past none concern still understand point view life judge live asked would feel bad hurt learning wife husband past especially sexual marriage most married recently could least understood long marriage aged couple bonded much enough past this reply always bother me ones didnt any much past especially men thats surprise cannot understand this appears unable digest fact person going share life things someone else saying end world least appears big deal me something forget past easily my questions cant digest is very much uncomfortable with wouldbe past okay really case not made different maybe didnt evolve much according current standards ways pun intended mean may well true 2 e many too saying so afraid labelled backward prudish 3 or plain wrong e grass indeed greener getting info wrong sources small demographic paranoid 4 supporting this dont idea or interest felt make sense all want make life e enjoy much marriage judgement here thats want live fine live way trying understand reality truth please dont label backward prudish actually open minded to extent apparently believe liberal values free spech equality questioning things rather blindly believing etc mysogynist either someone male shouldnt think better deserve things females my case still applies reverse genders gender applies race intellectuality status etc horrible thing descriminate basis sorry long post just felt details might help understand better x200b ps intimacy mean getting physical first base surprise there expected second third base home run cases saying that appears majority that might wrong happy stand corrected wanted action couldnt due inability factors dont want partner couldn t would makes hypocrite stud attractive didnt many encounters two or maybe not got tempted refrained morals thought would unfair expectations partner judgement all practice live let live if sounded so didnt mean happy correct wanted understand reality truth is

i'm on the lookout for any sort of employment for some quick cash.



literally any work....typing,editing, customer care, whatever.




i'm a 20 year old student.


i don't have any previous experience with office work.


 i had a brief stint as an intern under a marketer but there was no professional office work.


yes. i know about upwork.  i literally just made a profile.",is there any way for me to earn some money during this lockdown?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0l7es/is_there_any_way_for_me_to_earn_some_money_during/," to be honest, this is extremely unlikely. people much more qualified than you are also looking for work. 

there's just no demand for any of the services you can give as a fresher right now. if you have a 2 wheeler license then you can try applying for essential delivery services. it's a very important work but highly risky too so you might have to think of that.

apart from that you can try contacting ngos who are doing relief work if they need man power. i don't have anything but i read all the comments down below.

just goodluck man i'll pray you find something. you can try online tutoring. may not earn you much but it can meet your basic expenses like food. lots of platforms out there. can you do online tuitions? if yes, check out wirkace.com to sell your courses and build your education business.

if you have good listening skills you can try your hand at transcription. i freelance sporadically with scribe. they pay over paypal so you need a verified paypal account. here's a referral link to scribie: https://scribie.com/freelance-transcription?rc=2aad1d760b689a07d084741510aab9500e5c6efe#intro

all the best! look at job portals. people haven't stopped hiring. do you have a resume? if not, put one together. there are templates on the internet that are easy to use (check canva) and then start applying. no. i’m not great at giving expert advice in such situations but since you’re desperate, i will mention upwork and other freelancing websites. you can get paid for doing simple tasks like creating a website with a website builder (like making someone a website using wixx or wordpress etc), or doing simple photoshop work or anything you can do on the computer. logo design. browse around and see what services others are offering and see if you can do something like that too. there are plenty of great tutorials on how to earn a living with upwork on youtube. please check them out. ensure that your profile is approved first. there are a lot of jobs on upwork that doesn't require any knowledge or skills. you can start by doing jobs for the lowest amount possible and gradually build from there. any job during lockdown is appreciated r/slavelabour", WanderGatherRape agni69 spacejesus01 hungry4va JoyBarboza ohmyraul randomjoe46973 notoriousnationality minusSeven shankylion Mudi-kaka,way earn money really shaken family we re running extremely low rations nearly depleted funds lookout sort employment quick cash literally work typing editing customer care whatever 20 year old student previous experience office work brief stint intern marketer professional office work yes know upwork literally made profile

2. talk to the pg owner or if it is zolo or oyo life, mail them/tweet them about any possibility of delayed payment.
3. draft a nice little mail to your manager about the pay that you'd be needing in this excruciating condition. if it doesn't go the official way, then try to seek support.
4. go, create your upwork/fiverr/freelancer profile. don't let yourself down!

just make sure you communicate your condition properly to each and every stakeholder mentioned above.

Throwaway2442152,2020-03-12,AskIndia,116,273,False,"throwaway for obvious reasons. i left home for delhi yesterday. i'm 25 and i wasn't doing anything with my life, not going into much details here but on holi my family and older siblings decided that it's enough and i should leave home for good. they also went through my internet history which didn't paint a good picture of me either. so the next morning i left. i'm in delhi and i'm extremely short on funds, my dad told me he doesn't want me home. i'm a college drop out and have a decent education till 12th. i'm freaking out so i can't really decide what should i do, going back is not an option. i've never earned money before and i'm clueless on how to go about finding a job. what to do?

edit: a big thank you to everyone for reaching out, whether it's through the comments or in private messages. thank you for your kind words and suggestions, they are of great help. 

edit 1: one person have offered money and i would be lying if i said i'm not in the need of it. under normal circumstances i would never accept money like that. i'm still on the fence about whether to accept help that way or not.

edit 2: accepted 5000 from a stranger who don't wish to be named. loss of words at here but have my most sincere gratitude, to everyone who took time of their day to message and comment.",i've sort of ran away from home,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhb0bx/ive_sort_of_ran_away_from_home/," if you're looking to make some money and can write well, my company is hiring freelance writers. drop me a dm. if you are still in new delhi then go try find shelter where people affected from delhi riots are staying, most probably go to shaheen bagh area. try to stay there for a couple days. after that try gurudwara bangla sahib.

1. you can work in a bpo.
2. you can try talking to the authorities of bangla sahib and you can share your id for police verification. you are 18+ so you won't be dragged home. don't talk to the authorities immediately, you go there, help them in daily tasks such as serve langar and cleaning, no one is gonna ask you to leave. if they ask you then tell them the truth.
3. where are you currently in delhi if you share please tell.
4. call any number you can find, don't judge if it's true or false before you have a word with them.
5. travel only via metro if not then go for buses. get a metro card, don't worry.
6. do not give up. stay in touch via inbox. no need to worry, you can survive, now that you out there, it's really important to keep your eyes are ears open. be nice to everyone you meet, unless they try to harm you.

now that you are at the bottom of maslaws hierarchy, most important thing is to look after yourself, make sure you have something to eat, clean clothes to wear, place to sleep and don't fall sick.

you can either choose to be in some clean environment like malls n all for the whole day, use their washrooms n stuff to clean yourself up. maybe you can even find a job anywhere over there, food court, multiplex, retail shops, they always need people. or be out in large market places , with wholesale shops , local restaurants , retail shops, appliance shops  etc, chose any area you are comfortable to be in. where you can earn some money.

no need to worry or panic in case anything you try doesn't work initially, that's how you learn what not to do. slowly you will start figuring out what works for you and what doesn't . if you keep yourself alive day after day, you will be able to find a path to take you forward. sounds like a beginning of a wonderful life story. believe me when i say this, there will be a point in your life when you will sit sipping your coffee and reminiscing what you went through in life.

now focusing on the problem at hand. since you have nothing to loose ask any and every shop for work that you come across. target cloth stores and small mom and pop shops that might have a wanted boys and girls sign outside. make sure that you are properly dressed and prepped up. first impression is the last impression. be truthful in what you say you need not dodge on questions regarding your previous work experience and why you need a job. there is nothing to be ashamed of. 

be persistent in your search and never expect an outcome in your first go. if it happens, good, but if someone's asks you to contact them at a set time then you definitely do that. 

taking cue from how well you have written your post, i think you can speak fluent english and and hopefully hindi so drop in your resume at call centers located in and around delhi.

all the best and may you find success. maybe look for a job in the delivery industry till you figure out what you want to do with your life. hey man. i'm sorry for the situation you are in. first of all, just walk up to businesses and inquire if they have any job availability (any work will do for now). hotels/ restaurants usually let you sleep & eat on the premises. 

if that doesn't work out, try to stay in hostel, dorms, etc.(rs.20/- per day). once you work for a few days and have a base(temporary shelter) and a few bucks in your pocket, you can apply for jobs & give interviews in offices, call centres, etc.

karna hai toh karna hai. i wish you all the best man. can you drive? if you are looking for immediate jobs, try going to a driver center, and see if they can hire you. nice! here's where the fun starts. some great suggestions here but i'll double down on the one that i think is most important.   


go and ask for a job. knock on doors. tell them what you can do! it'll be tough but while you apply online just get started on the ground!  


also keep good track of your finances and plan ahead. bet wishes.

&#x200b;

problem i have is nobody defines god, they'll just start giving an answer based on what they believe everyone else thinks god is. is god greybearded judeochristian fellow? personification of some force of nature? the laws of physics? stupid question unless you define god i consider myself an atheist, stopped being religious 3 years ago although my family is still hindu.

also checkout r/atheismindia i believe i'm an i-don't-care-ist. 😁 is there anything for in between lol i think i fit as an agnostic. while i don't think that god would exist, i feel the need to give my gratitude to something or someone. i am an 'agnostic dystheist' so i don't fit into any of your category unfortunately people in india would be hesitant to identify as atheists proudly and openly as there is shit ton of moral policing online and offline mostly by middle aged and old people and ignorants from all places as usual. some here are confusing between rejection of religion and disbelief of god. i am still pondering about the philosophical aspects of both sides but i would mostly retain culture from my religion (ofc only the good parts) if i ever considered atheism in future i am atheist and i am proud of it , it's even my facebook cover photo 
why would anyone be afraid of saying it?

throwaway9055555,2020-04-05,AskIndia,51,40,False,"i hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.

so we screwed this up pretty badly. my boyfriend is indian-american, his parents are south indian and arrived in the late 90s. they're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

switch to me. i'm very in love with him. we've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. he met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an ldr. he loves me too. we mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. incidentally, i'm canadian. i'm about to graduate from university. once i do, i want to live with him again. the only way i can do that with my credentials is get married. we don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

switch to his parents. because we live apart i only met them once on the pretense that i was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. he has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. obviously, they fucking lose it. now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. all things i deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. but the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that i'm not the brahmin doctor they wanted. the not being indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. his mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""i'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

what we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. but we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. but now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5am last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

i don't expect them to ever accept me. i want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear i don't want their goddamn money. but my boyfriend/fiancee and i want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. i just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. thinking about this call makes me nauseous. they're just gonna tell me i'm useless for however many minutes. 

idk that anyone can give advice but i need to try so i have less of a chance of screwing things up. thanks randia.

tl;dr how to convince somewhat religious telugu-american parents to go easy on their son for choosing a non-indian girl and at least give us a chance?",how do i get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/," do not bother to convince them now, just sign relevant agreements and marry your boyfriend. after few years, once you get a kid, do his/her naming ceremony from your parent in law's house, they will first accept your kid and then yourself. what a nice deviation from the usual gloom and doom. but i think zealous indian parents may be as bad as the virus. anyway. 

there's nothing so far that you can do. the onus is on your boyfriend. indian parents, for the most part, in situations like this, will eventually mellow out if the son takes a strict no nonsense attitude. which is difficult for some indian men. being so reliant on the parents as they are.

just be yourself. don't try to placate them too much. they don't have the right to give you a hard time just because you're not the bride they were expecting. telugu family..?... try saying you'll give more dowry... if they are religious, the key is the horoscope. 

it's dumb but that's what it is. sit down and talk with them. take the bitter pill. you'd be better of correcting what you missed out on from the start of your relationship - getting to know his parents. bitter because this won't be easy - they'll humiliate you and test you. go through it with what you have, but also be prepared to tell them off if they cross any limit - and they will. call out on their manipulative tactics to your boyfriend - but also be careful there.

indian parents are a strange breed - and that too south indians.

i'm gonna get criticised for saying this, but fuck it: on the note that you're planning for your future, ask yourself, is this the environment you'd want your child to grow up in? always beware of a toxic environment.

again, look out for any and all manipulative tactics.

wishing you good luck. stay safe, stranger. have you considered getting your boyfriend to move to canada instead of the other way round? at least that way his parents can't forcibly take him back because border control is a legitimate hurdle. just ignore them and get married. you being white is not the issue, you being someone which their son  chose (instead of them) is the problem. while reading it i could totally relate to the father getting depressed and mother shouting thing. that is exactly what my husbands parents did.(and i am hindu indian girl, we belong to same fucking religion but is just not somebody who suits their prodigal son)
even if they come around which will be unwillingly it is still going to be difficult for you for some initial years of marriage. 
just ignore them, get court marriage done. they will try to emotional blackmail your guy, hope he is smart enough to ignore that.
don’t give in to all the drama of “we are your parents, we did so much for you etc etc”. 
just get married and let them come to terms with this on their own.
it is your life and you both are the one who are going to spend it for the rest of your life.

and if he is nri then it becomes easy to get married. 
but if the boy is from india and you have to get married in indian court of law then the process is a bit tedious but doable. you cannot make every one happy. if you guys are happy together, you will be miserable apart. 

give them space and time. if after sometime, they still don't listen, take a call. 

happiness together or misery apart.

either way, take care and stay safe. how fucked up is it that there's a post like this every month? just tells you about the priorities that indian parents have. good luck op. damn i am a telugu indian...spare with my english..ykr.... 

basically (no offense to any one)  brahmin caste is highest in the hierarchy in inian caste system and particularly too orthodox with their traditions customs ect....in indian it's sad but marriages occur inside same castes...but there are exceptions in some cases were people get married to foreigners too.... all indian parents are like that(as u explained) .....basically but u need to figure out how  his parents are ...........

1(completely orthodox) these people don't care about their son or daughter but only honour ..caste and religion always comes into their mind  ..if his parents are like this then u are doomed..........

2(little liberal)they care about their son's happiness even sacrificing their honour....take time ...meet them... don't be like typical american...search about ethical wear,customs and traditions of telugu community..meet them in saree if possible..talk to them maturely not like a child  ..try to impress them.. try to be honest and they will accept u.......

in general sense indian men are good..... so don't loose him if he sincerely loves u...all the best...and (checkout about dowry). arey yaar kya hai yaar, arey ye kon hai yaar?", satyasys shitdick4000 newinvestor0908 sameolmee charm-admin iheartsubmariner throaway010101 dr137 xScar_258 perrygadu Communism_Bad,boyfriend parents give chance hate white girl barging global pandemic talk shit anyone wants mind sweet in law drama read on screwed pretty badly boyfriend american parents south arrived late 90s they re pretty liberal open minded nice generally he child kind prodigal son every he dated anyone they ve given extremely hard switch me love him we ve together 2 5 years first 7 months basically living together tiny cramped dorm room choice arguments amazing met term abroad broke left stand apart spent together ldr loves too mesh well together similar aspirations support another think future want build deal terrors life throw us incidentally canadian graduate university do want live again way credentials married want wedding anything want sign fucking papers border guards let us breakfast together every day switch parents live apart met pretense friend think point would stay together recently told want continue relationship cohabitation requires legal maneuvering obviously fucking lose marriage table parading real problems consequences financial costs we re young etc things deeply sympathise broke first place thinking better thing that plagued everything start since first found dating brahmin doctor wanted really consistent theme since first met mom fucking cries dad depressed financial problems hurt me every something take chance lash this done told beginning let know me build relationship know anyone except gori witch steal child foresight worried reasonable things worried wrt committing young commitment clear cat bag dad yelling 5am last night saying want talk today basically tell fuck life together expect ever accept me want prenup whatever fuck makes clear want goddamn money boyfriend fiancee want start building life together immediately however many years line they ll decide he settled especially he settled girl whose family scrutinise surname want give little hard possible preferably me too thinking call makes nauseous they re gonna tell useless however many minutes idk anyone give advice need try less chance screwing things up thanks randia tl dr convince somewhat religious telugu american parents go easy son choosing non girl least give us chance
ouchmytongue,2020-04-06,AskIndia,32,81,False,"so i live in america and work in the home of a family from india. i tutor their child. since schools have cancelled for the year in my state they have increased my hours, meaning that i am around for lunchtime now, and they have absolutely insisted on feeding me. this is very nice of them and all of the food they have made me is delicious, but they give me so much! i'll tell them that i'm full but then they'll bring me another portion, and i feel like i must eat it because it would be rude to refuse. is there a way to tactfully tell them when i've had enough food? the last thing i want to do is disrespect their generosity!",american wondering how to tactfully refuse food,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw3ws1/american_wondering_how_to_tactfully_refuse_food/," welcome to indian kitchens. this is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. this way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.

edit: do bring in a dessert sometime. return the favour! indian families generally insist on serving more food until you insist you are full. it’s a cultural thing. 

in older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. this was understood by the host. the hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

these days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in american culture i observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). but sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. they will usually understand.

another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. this gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

thank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. 

hope this helps. oh boy...i have some good tips for you..

1) eat slow
2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable
3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. 


tried and tested in the field.
p.s: all techniques tested on my wife's family where i face the same issue. i am fasting today. typical indian household lol. it's endearing in a way but tbh i always feel like i can't walk or that i am going to throw up.

just insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. it wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them “you guys also eat, i’ll take how much ever i want, i don’t want to trouble you”) . eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. initially smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. many years ago, a fellow american friend i knew in dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. the cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** guests will usually not directly say - ""yes, i do want more"". instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. so, when you actually do become full and definitely don't want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. you have to insist, like one of the other comments said. don't worry, it's not rude. another tip is - eat slowly. if you finish too fast, they'll think you're still hungry. why do you think most indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? i don't understand what it is with parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it's clearly not. my diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if i refuse to eat more. they just put more on the plate and i have to eat because i don't like wasting food. i need to be more stern otherwise i have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs. refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudely", ABahRunt kranganath net_2 satyasys maddragon95 thegodfather0504 Fun_parent nitroglider cateater crikeymikey1 TagMeAJerk,american wondering tactfully refuse food live america work home family tutor child since schools cancelled year state increased hours meaning around lunchtime now absolutely insisted feeding me nice food made delicious give much ll tell full they ll bring another portion feel must eat would rude refuse way tactfully tell ve enough food last thing want disrespect generosity

quar198,2020-04-13,AskIndia,46,14,False,"27 yo here, and i am currently with my girlfriend for the last 1 year. we have a great understanding between us and we have opened up and talked about our lives before one another. i have grown up in a relatively conservative family. although my parents were never against meeting girls (or dating one), i just could not devote any time towards it during undergraduate due to the heavy workload of an engineering degree. so this was my first real relationship and i am very happy with my partner (same age as me).

however, her undergrad life was very different, which included lots of drinking, partying, dating, sex, and several hookups. today, she is very focussed on her career, makes healthier lifestyle choices (no more substances and drinking), and is making conscious efforts to make a life for herself that she can be proud of (she isn't proud of anything she's done in the past and has broken all ties with people from that time). to be clear, i myself have never indulged in alcohol, substances, partying, or hookups.

we both get along really well, and i have been trying to be very open-minded about her past (given that it is very much on the opposite side of the spectrum to mine). i don't want to sound regressive because i understand this happens, but i am unsure how to cope with the feelings of discomfort and off-putting mental images that come up in my mind. to add, we have decided to wait for sex until after marriage (if and when it gets to that stage in life). 

i want to deal with this because i respect her and want to be with her. any suggestions?",dealing with partner's past,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0nkfo/dealing_with_partners_past/," the last bit is problematic, about waiting for sex until marriage. it would be one thing if she was a virgin and wanted to keep it that way until marriage, this just sounds like her making sure you stay on the hook.

as for the partying etc, everyone has made mistakes they are not proud of. so its unlikely to happen again. read her this post word by word. don’t change a thing. cross this bridge as soon as possible.
no point in saving it up for future ,these feelings will explode like pressure cooker.

do tell us the outcome. everything seemed fine until the part where you talked about waiting until marriage. it almost sounds like she's just looking for a nice sanskari but liberal guy like you to settle down with now that she's had all the fun of her 20s. if it was just casual between you two, you should continue no peoblem.but you're looking at marriage.you have had a conservative upbringing and lifestyle. that's your identity. being with someone who is exact opposite is going to hit your identity and that will have consequenses. you might turn bitter and it will explode one day. to think that you should  not have sex before marriage is not regressive, it is what it is, you shouldn't be ashamed of that. if it's just your first relationship i would say hold on the marriage. be a bit more experienced. then you won't be bothered by girls having multiple partners in the past. 
the girl is not in wrong here it's your values and feelings which will clash. believe me more than half of your involves issues relating to manifestation of somewhat inferiority complex and comparison relating to something that you think that you haven't experienced 

it's like all your thoughts somewhat are leading to the physical side of the relationship
it's like she has done all this and i'm stuck in a rut .

and the fact that you have put off sex till marriage is another issue 
according to yourself, you are not conservative or regressive.

it's difficult to comprehend that she's been sexually active with someone and it's still something that you haven't done
you're thinking that whether you're going to be good enough for her or is it like she's just with me because she has made some changes in the lifestyle and is trying to adhere to it and if you're just someone who's there to give her emotional support and nothing else.

this all seems like you have reached a point where you need to talk with your partner 
remember don't break up if you're happy with her 

i would like to suggest that you should be real and accept that you have physical desires and all , it's all a part of being human .

at the end ,marriage is nothing but a social construct of the society i wouldn't marry someone like that. might love her but not marry. 

why should i be the one to deal with baggage. not like she will die if you leave her. 

aisa bhi kya relationship bhai jisme aapko apne se compromise krna pde. 

if you are not comfortable,get out. it will never go away. that unsettling uncomfortable feeling will be always there in your heart. i'm currently 23 and i've been with people like you and your girlfriend. it's very common and none of you should beat yourself up for what you were in the past. her honesty about the past is what's very impressive. 

what exactly do you fear? you say the images of her past is off-putting, but didn't tell why you feel that way.

 is it because you fear that you might just be one of those guys? is it because you feel like she'll eventually hookup with someone else while she's with you? is it because you feel insecure because you don't have the same experience as her when it comes to sex? 

i still don't understand the sex part. i personally feel like waiting for the right person approach will ultimately lead to disappointment. i feel like there's a lot more to relationship than sex. these feelings of discomfort you feel today, if you wont accept it completely, it will only increase with time... more time you wait to leave her more difficult it would get. remember one thing, whatever you do, how hard you try, you cannot change your nature(unless you are very much focused,with clear goal of what you want to achieve by the change). same goes for you and your partner. so, before taking any step, think thoroughly and apart from your partner talk to people whom you really trust. it seems you are not prepared for her past. it will keep bothering you. think really hard if you want to proceed any further. nobody can change his/her character, given opportunity(foreign trip/compulsion/family fights), she will do it again and again.

if she is still in touch with her ex hookups even via email/text/f\*ckbook, they may simply hookup in one hour notice, when you happen to go out of city, etc.

**you have to accept her as she is.**

ok bhaktjanos, now start down voting me. one thing that might help is talking about these things with her. as you have written that there is good understanding between you two. be clear about your feelings and how her past is making you a lil bit uncomfortable. i am sure she would be able to understand and together you two would figure out something.", throwawayr4r240891 MadMurDoc69 icantdothisrn doordie786 Dino_567 CloutCobain-18 gode_rastheya_thola ak32009 Jtu143 satyasys captainmogambo,dealing partner past 27 yo here currently girlfriend last year great understanding us opened talked lives another grown relatively conservative family although parents never meeting girls or dating could devote towards undergraduate due heavy workload engineering degree first real relationship happy partner same age me however undergrad life different included lots drinking partying dating sex several hookups today focussed career makes healthier lifestyle choices no substances drinking making conscious efforts make life proud she proud anything done past broken ties clear never indulged alcohol substances partying hookups along really well trying open minded past given much opposite side spectrum mine want sound regressive understand happens unsure cope feelings discomfort off putting mental images come mind add decided wait sex marriage if gets stage life want deal respect want her suggestions

impstuff,2020-04-07,AskIndia,28,64,False,"my dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. he gets most of his news from republic tv and is a heavy modi/bjp supporter. recently, with the jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for covid-19 testing. i obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but i also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

my dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. he believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. i tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in china, but he believes that china is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

he also believes that the human rights violations against uyghurs in china is acceptable (!!!) because, and i quote, ""they were trying to convert the chinese to islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, i said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. does our judicial system have flaws? of course, and i agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

i'm currently studying abroad in a western country where i'm obviously a minority, so i naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. i asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

authoritarianism works until it doesn't. authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

how do i explain this to him? i'm considering never discussing politics with him for i adore and respect my dad and i'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things. fml.",[p] how to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwo8b6/p_how_to_deal_with_parents_who_support_extreme/," i'm here in nz , my mom in india has been sending me non scientific deranged advice from random whatsapp forwards...n glorifying modi in every forward. i'm so over it . she says she will support and believe every forward above me her daughter telling her to just take care. some people cannot be saved. and after an age the mind resists change.

there is nothing conventional that will help you. you would be surprised at the number of people in my family who’ve casually mentioned shooting them down in the past week. i’m the only person against authoritarianism in my family, everybody else seems to support it even nri uncles who are minorities where they live. all my friends are sanghis too, two of my best friends (like top 5) have turned out to be xenophobic bigots, vocal islamophobes and rss sympathisers. 

for the fascists, it does not matter wether or not there is a minority because if there isn’t a minority, they will create one. if there were no muslims in india, would everyone be hindu? no. they’d be brahmins, dalits and women. perhaps once people start looking beyond their privileges and start hearing beyond our fascist enabling airwaves maybe a bulb will light up at the end of the tunnel. 

our own households are xenophobic, patriarchal and misogynistic. it can be easy to loose hope every now and then. however, it is essential that we keeping forward even if only by a little bit, everyday. each person that switches over from zee news to ndtv is a step in the right direction. i’m not saying ndtv is perfect but it is a step in the right direction. 

while you try and tackle these issues in your own home, take care of your mental health, this is exhausting and tough so don’t beat yourself up. keep talking with your parents but talk, don’t mock. it's not just your dad, a lot of people share the same ideology. you can't really do anything about it; just let it be.

no offence but ""silence is the best reply to a fool"". get him to watch ravish kumar ndtv prime..some shut up ya kunal, little varun grover.
start with small doses.

it will take a month for effects to show.
for extreme cases, it might take 3 months to get rid of the disease. 

this disease is more dangerous to india in the long term. what's the caste of your family? if you're obc, you can play the same game of high caste vs low caste, as said in manusmriti. not following manusmriti is going against hinduism and modiji. 
ask you father to pay more respect to his high caste friends. lots of replies here mentioning you should evade or ignore. wrong. you should clearly let him know how you detest his views without detesting him personally. this is the first step towards liberalism. attack the idea, not the man. at the same time, don't hold back from defending your ideas just because people you like may not agree with them what you can do in my humble opinion, is try to show examples from history or even in modern day - where people have been seduced into accepting an authoritarian strongman in the promise of a strong economy or stability (even if it means at the cost of hurting minorities). what we have observed is that these kind of authoritarians aren't able to kickstart the economy in the way they promise.

look at russia with putin, hungary with viktor orban, brazil with bolsonaro.

yoj could also make the economic argument that persecuting minorities makes the country unfavorable to investment, to businesses and for the economy in general. conflict and social tension decreases cohesiveness and in turn increases the probability of a tail risk.

take for example the protests in delhi, for the large majority of hindus, they aren't probably affected themselves, but the protests have cemented a reputation of india turning into a hostile state for minorities globally.

there's no point arguing over morality with people who have already given in to the dark side, if you want to change their opinions you have to be pragmatic and argue from the focus that personally affects them. persecution of minorities doesn't affect them directly and thus they don't care, or they might even personally condone it. but showing how such acts can negatively affect themselves can change their position to a more moderate stance from their current veering towards extremist ideology. i'm in the same situation as op.  my dad was never religious, he had many muslim friends but, now he has started making hateful comments. i tried to reason with him but he made an argument that because he is in the country, he knows better.

i hate that the pandemic is being communalised in india and i cannot let him have his beliefs when, his beliefs are based on whatsapp news and trp hungry, propaganda pushing media channels. 
 
now, i listen to the anti muslim news he has ( like i'm genuinely interested to know), i then share fact checked articles on it and complain about shitty media. you don't deal with them. you form your own opinions and let them have theirs. hey, my mother too asked if they could just kill everyone from the tabhligi jamat too. same whatsapp forwards i guess", crazyindahead warabhi piewala mehrasaur net_2 UserameChecksOut giggitygoo666 IHateAnimus lizzy_wasp sidiy26 DayaGatekholna,p deal parents support extreme authoritarianism dad seems going path extreme authoritarianism gets news republic tv heavy modi bjp supporter recently jamat news heated discussion actually suggested support killing offenders without fair trial refused give covid 19 testing obviously think evade authorities offenders punished think nobody right unilaterally take someone else life put prison rest lives ffs kill them dad says they ll make communal affair as deep seated contempt muslims entire judicial system done away with believes authorities rights without checks tried reason slippery slip leads nazism 2 0 suppressed population china believes china ruthlessly efficient system greater good believes human rights violations uyghurs china acceptable because quote they trying convert chinese islam though evidence that strong evidence something that lawfully illegal somehow said still need judicial system rule unlawful judicial system flaws course agree dad point instead improving faster fairer remove altogether give absolute power already corrupt system currently studying abroad western country obviously minority naturally asked he d support authoritarianism injustice done me son asked he d okay system leaves legal recourse discrimination hindu minority me basically evaded question authoritarianism works doesn t authoritarianism cool long agree power power corrupts soon system oppression authoritarianism okay long affect family explain him considering never discussing politics adore respect dad d hate see strong relationship degrade bit things fml
Death1s1nevitable,2020-03-23,AskIndia,63,151,False,"i am from west bengal. and honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. the prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. even though i am from a middle class family, i know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. if people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

i don't know about economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? from what i know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. what about most of us? 

another thing is jobs. due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. and if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

edit: i sometimes go on libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. is this really a sound solution?",[stupid but serious question] won't there be a point where loss of life and economy due to lockdown will be greater than loss of life due to coronavirus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnizym/stupid_but_serious_question_wont_there_be_a_point/," the price rise is a bullwhip effect. everyone is stocking up now, so there are some shortages. in a week to 10 days, there will be surplus because noone will be buying at the time.

yes, life for poorer people is going to be very very difficult.

however, hopefully people will learn that a lockdown is not a curfew. there is no restriction n going out for essential purposes and neither is there any closure of essential services. hopefully we will be able to develop a rythm

economy wise of course, things are going to be very very bad. not a stupid question. it's a really important question. i don't know too much about it, but essential items include food items and groceries, so inter-state transport of these stuff is allowed.

centre and state should announce a dbt to the poorer people soon, to compensate for loss of work. and also make available groceries as well. neither can they work, nor do they have money. kerala has announced that groceries would be available. similarly delhi has announced the same. centre needs to augment the states with similar stimulus package. they should, in theory, be able to help out the poorer strata. the civil society organisations as well as private industries should also help out in this manner. adopt a district or a village or couple of families. we can help oit as well.

it's gonna be a rough couple of years for modi and his cabinet. the economy was already on a downslide, it could go into free fall soon. we need to inject state money into the market sooner rather than later.

and since it's a contagious disease, loss of lives due to illness would inevitably be larger than loss of lives due to lack of food or lack of money, if unfettered movement continues. look at italy. they went about normally around their days and they're fucked. and also, the poor strata would be disproportionately affected due to covid as well. i can afford to go to a private hospital for treatment, the poor cannot. 

lockdown is just more effective to contain covid. and like always, poor are collateral damage. it's not a stupid question. it will impact or already has, around the world its not only our country. there will be a ripple effect across industries those money muscle might even close. it will recover with time as with any calamity. dude if there's no lockdown , there won't be any economy left . maybe not, i mean china and south korea managed to contain by observing strict quarantines. it's definitely possible. there are two important points one is loss of life and resources the second and probably more devastating is the breaking up of supply chains.
the first one in a young population is quite maintainable and we could probably have lost a few million people and no one would bat an eye but the second one is much more devastating.
let's say the goverment does not lockdown and in a few months we have those millions death i talked about before.then it spreads rapidly, causing people to drop out of work, panic buy and hoard in turn caussing essential services to shut down. population becomes aggrresive and downright uncontrollable that's when we lose trillions of dollars in economic impact and many many millions more people due to food shortage, distribution problems and in general lack of essential services. 
note: increased cases also mean our health infrastructure crumble as professional start getting sick and scared causing them to run away from work. about your edit: it effects every one. even the young have died from it. i saw a post of  a doctor who helplessly saw one his 24m patient die gasping for air.

&#x200b;

currently the thought process goes like, we will rebuild the economy if we live to see it through. i think your question from the libertarian sub is explained here

https://youtu.be/ofslpdqx1ba?t=422

basically even if you just lock up the at risk population, the number of death will be still damn high. also its not like healthy young adults are completely ""immune"" to the worst effects of disease. 

by the end of the year i'm sure some other disease will be the largest cause of death but covid-19 will have killed more in a shorter time span while bringing the healthcare system to its knees. the loss of lives if there are zero checks would be scales of magnitude higher than if there is a lockdown.

there's a great study by the financial times on this.
 https://mobile.twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240629424871047168

with zero checks, the us death toll would be 2.2 million. you can imagine how bad it would be in india.

containment is the only option. yes, it will hurt millions in the short term, but there's no other option. if there is no lockdown, then the cases will reach thousands and then economy will be worse than what it is after lockdown. we don't have infra to treat thousands at the same time in a country of 1.3 billion people. things can we avoided easily if the state government array facilities where people can easily buy supplies from home. i don't know about west bengal but i live in delhi and haven't left my mouse for anything for supplies for months :3

Smooth_Guidance,2020-04-07,AskIndia,33,65,False,"personally, i believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after april 14 if lockdown is revoked.

* india’s current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. which i think is nowhere near enough. 

* united states had around 5000 cases before march 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on march 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

even if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the nizamuddin dargah, hundreds of people celebrating ram navmi despite lockdown, dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on april 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s diwali... so, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve. may sources also claimed india will peak the epidemic around april first week, which is far from truth. but according to speculations from artificial intelligence, india will peak during june-july..",do you think india should revoke lockdown on april 14 ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwm5c3/do_you_think_india_should_revoke_lockdown_on/," its a very complicated scenario tbh. on the one hand, as you said, we havent done enough testing compared to other countries and considering our population we should be testing 5x more aggressively. so yes, lockdown needs extension. on the other hand, considering economy, the livelihood of daily wage workers, agricultural sector, and also the impact of lockdown on mental health i think it should be lifted. im pretty sure the decision makers are facing similar dilemma. i'd say 1) ramp up testing rates 2) ensure everyone has masks to wear 3) revoke lockdown in phases i feel like places will be more highly crowded than usual with people who are desperate to go out.

i think we’ll all be waking up to a new reality after this lockdown is lifted.  i feel many more people will continue to get infected and die. # no

wait, lockdown? the one we break every sunday? lockdown without a comprehensive testing strategy and a phased release would be ineffective and perpetual. we have actually wasted these 14 days by not testing enough. should have tested around 5 l people by now. the extension of lockdown is necessary now. no. if it's really required, we should open up cities and districts (for travel inside these zones) with no cases, but people should not be able to enter or leave these zones. in my area i know families which are really struggling to accumulate money for upcoming months.
they have issues like money to pay for childrens school, they are not earring anything right now how they are going to sustain any expenditure in future months. 
those families somehow managing their food with government support and relatives debt but man believe me situation is do or die for them...
they need a way to earn money, so in that sense lockdown should be uplifted.

at least for them... the real number of cases in india is at least 10 times the official number of cases. we know that a majority of novel coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, i.e. no cough and cold, no fever, no breathing distress. among the 20%-25% cases which are symptomatic, very few have symptoms severe enough to warrant a visit to the hospital (let's say 10% of the real number of infected cases, i don't have any stats to back up this number, i just pulled it out of thin air), and only 2%-3% will die. 

conversations with doctors (and their fb posts) in many rural districts of my home state (wb) have shown me that the situation is dire. doctors and nurses finally have enough ppe, but the overwhelming number of cases has totally destroyed the brittle public health infrastructure. most patients with covid-19 symptoms are just getting pneumonia and malaria medicines, and are being sent home, because there aren't enough testing kits, and not nearly enough beds.

make no mistake, the real, actual number of people infected in india could well be past 1 crore at this point, and we still wouldn't know unless the govt aggressively ramps up testing. in such a situation, where so many migrant workers who've returned to their villages as asymptomatic carriers, in addition to people who've attended various religious gatherings, the national lockdown doesn't really matter. it won't stop the spread any further. it is over, coronavirus has won, and a population roughly the size of dharavi is expendable. well. i'd like to be out and about again but its very difficult for me to decide. i'd like things to be normal but we have a pathetic medical system and we wont be able to control the spread of the virus if we do. on the other hand we have so many people that live hand to mouth that have lost their daily income. there seems to be no reasonable answer here tricky situation. economy needs some revival. a staggered opening, followed by a complete lockdown once again seems to be on the cards.", httpwtf sudoko1234 zxkool Neglectedsince1994 manofsteel911 AnxiousBlock clickOKplease ptah_chaser IamFluffy94 HairLikeWinterFire gajendray5,think revoke april 14 personally believe corona virus cases would increase exponentially april 14 revoked current total infected cases 4 900 testing 12 000 per day think nowhere near enough united states around 5000 cases march 20 testing around 50 000 per day increased 10 000 testing per day march 25 corona virus cases started exploding we re plenty incidents happened recently might caused mass community spreading nizamuddin dargah hundreds celebrating ram navmi despite dharavi slum incident mass migrations april 5 too almost everywhere from big cities small towns started celebrating diwali so incidents caused tons new cases they d mostly show symptoms over d started disastrous community spreading continue low rates testings we ll never able figure peak curve may sources claimed peak epidemic around april first week far truth according speculations artificial intelligence peak june july

where should i start to become active ? please advice.",i'm always unmotivated: need advice and help,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fybsqe/im_always_unmotivated_need_advice_and_help/," you can try dopamine fast. it is basically not using your phone, pc or anything you feel is time wasting but you like using/doing it anyways. so basically you don't use any of those things as soon as you wake up, because once your brain releases too much dopamine everything else less interesting would feel boring to do and you would procrastinate alot. inshort get all your important work done then use your phone, internet. first things first, if you are physically tired it's a medical problem, not a mental problem.

take care of the fundamentals first: drink enough water, eat enough food, get enough sleep. reduce the amount of fat you consume, especially saturated fat. try some physical activity (cleaning up your house, rearranging things is physical activity). talk to a doctor, try to get some tests for anemia, vitamin d, diabetes etc. you may well have a medical problem.

now leaving aside the physical problem, you may well have anxiety issues - i had that too for decades, and therapy changed my life. i used to procrastinate all the time due to anxiety, therapy really helped me learn how to deal with such problems.

you may have depression, so look into that too. are you me?  

edit: idk what this is called but i am doing this too. i wake up, use my phone and sleep. i'm so lazy that i don't want to get up and get myself a glass of water.  

i have a lot of pending work to do, assignments and studying since months. i have not touched anything.  

as someone suggested above, i'll try the dopamine fast thing.  

it seems to be a good way. i've been on my phone and computer for a seriously long time and it feels like it has reduced my thinking abilities significantly. i want to start reading books, doing maths to keep my brain from going fully idle.  

my eyes are also giving up. but i don't feel any energy to any of the things i want to. sometimes i feel like i don't have any future.  

if anybody here can help me keep myself motivated to do the right thing for myself. please drop a dm. check testosterone levels. im 99% sure you have low test levels. do you like watching birds ? if yes , go out and do the same . if you hold a regular job, and are doing well in it, and managed to continue your education without any hassles, what more motivation do you need ? 


capitalism has instilled this idea that we need to be productive all the time every second of our existence. nope. as long as you're reasonably coasting by, you're fine. if your job performance and career prospects in the office are getting affected due to said laziness and lack of motivation, then go see a psychiatrist. read atomic habbits go in for a consultation with a psychiatrist. sounds like early stage of depression. is this a general thing, or lockdown specific? get disciplined, force yourself to do things. motivation is only there to get started with things. you have to endure the mental pain of doing something consistently even when there's zero motivation, when you keep consistently doing things and see them through to end, it will become a habit. go checkout /r/getdisciplined to get help and see how others are doing it. i've used habitica for this in the past. it basically gamifies the activity tracking (idk if that's your taste, but keeping track of things is useful, and not breaking a streak is a decent motivation for most tasks). 

whatever area you want to focus on, give yourself small tasks based on that. want to run - 10 mins a day, read - 2 pages a day. then work from that.

in my experience, instead of trying to eliminate bad habits (say mobile and tv in your case), trying to find alternatives for your downtime works better. i've replaced most of media consumption with books (mostly fiction, but still better than 8 hours of youtube). start doing random shit, draw, write, cook, doesn't have to be good, just something that requires active participation. maybe you'll find a habit you like, or atleast you will get a detox from tv.", kushal1509 aperture_synce oiltel JoeKkerr SabBarabar OneLoki ruenigma TyrannosaurHex adityaxg FatalTouch doctorjohnx,always unmotivated need advice help always feel tired lazy lethargic feel slacking couch whole day mobile constantly watching tv feel sleepy too major concern zero motivation anything well educated hold regular job iq average helping break lethargy can t keep consistency whatever do run day treadmill discontinue start become active please advice

in any case, their claim over the territory was short-lived (~200 years, give or take), as [adil shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adil_shahi_dynasty) of bijapuri fame routed them from the north, and the south being as unguarded as it was, was soon conquered by [devaraja wodeyar ii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chikka_devaraja) who ruled from mysore.

add more wodeyars, hyder ali, then a sultan called tipu, another wodeyar or two (because the brits transferred it ""back"" to the wodeyars after the fall of tipu in 1799 in the [fourth-anglo mysore war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_anglo-mysore_war) which i kid you not, had [freaking rockets!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mysorean_rockets)), and yeah, by the 1800s the area was firmly in control of the [kingdom of mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_mysore). they divided their territory for easier governance into 6 parts and later down to 4, bengaluru, chitradurga, ashtagram, and nagar.

the region you mention is [pavagada taluk](http://www.pavagadatown.mrc.gov.in/), which till 1886 was part of chitradurga district, and post 1886 part of tumkur district. it's the second biggest taluk in tumkur district (areawise) and much like its origin, it still has a linguistic ratio of 1:1, kannada:telugu (though i'm sure each side will opine they're the majority).

the unfortunate part about its landlocked island like existence is a perpetual water crisis, whether [lack of](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/slow-poison-residents-k-taka-taluk-are-ailing-due-fluoride-contamination-79157) or [pollution therein](https://www.deccanherald.com/state/fluorosis-plays-havoc-lives-706330.html).

bit of an anti-climax, but hey, at least someone like you noticed *that small part*. that has to count for something.


edit: changed tumkur to tumkur district, so as to avoid unnecessary confusion. majority of indian states are formed on basis of linguistics indian state boundaries are based on language. they are not artificial boundaries. if you find this absurd please read berubari union case it is next level

[wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/india%e2%80%93bangladesh_enclaves)

[india-bangladesh enclaves](https://i.imgur.com/uah83jy.png) what’s the problem here? do you mean to say that area belongs to andhra?

or that small area feels like it should be in andhra? similarly, you can ask about some of the union territories too. i am from this place.

pavagada belonged to chitradurga district long ago now its in tumkur district, but pavagada votes for chitradurga mp candidate. majority of people speak telugu here & in some villages people can't even speak kannada.

fun fact: it has world's largest solar park. tbh what difference does it make if it's karnataka and not andhra?

i mean other than language used around the city on boards will be kannada instead of telugu.

do some states have exclusive rights that others don't? nope. 

so it comes down to what language and local population relate to more. doesn't matter if they are landlocked from 4 sides also.

there is freedom of movement, freedom of finding jobs and settling on either state so who cares?

btw you didn't notice a similar small piece of land engulfed between tamil nadu and karnataka at the bottom of andhra state that belongs to andhra. should we cut and split that between karnataka and tamil nadu, just because..... it is not fully enclosed by andra. there are narrow connections via land - forms a sort of yin-yang structure. check google maps to get a clearer picture. this debate is as useless as the belgavi/belgaon one op, no.offense but seriously.", FIndia clipy2 coronajihad Mudi-kaka jamesmoi mpwala aluminuman7 pagalpanti Gideon_Nomad Lolwall_here,earth would karnataka piece land almost fully enclosed andhra look image added imgur imgur m73hoh3 png here see highlighted part seems within ap except small opening yet ka look closer see area except stronger point know would cause whoever drew lines leave small part ka accepted answer reddit r comments g0iwo1 why_on_earth_would_karnataka_own_a_piece_of_land fnb3h0q
nota_grammar_nazi,2020-04-12,AskIndia,49,9,False,"when we compare ourselves to people in the west, i think we can say that we are just as talented as them if not more and we have a bigger population which means the number of intelligent indians is more even if the percentage of intelligent indians is not higher. 

but why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? i am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

in my opinion the reason why americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. we should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

please note that i am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. i was just wondering why as a country we all do this. i also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

edit: apparently this is an unpopular opinion on my part due to the downvotes",why are we indians bad at taking risks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzr4n4/why_are_we_indians_bad_at_taking_risks/," the thing is they have governments to save their asses in case of unemployment we don't

also status they arent afraid to do small odd jobs at mcdonalds or babysitting or something like that

we are taught that such jobs are only for the uneducated and unqualified and only a prestigous job would get us somewhere in society wait, i'm confused.

are you equating intelligence/iq/grades or however you choose to define it (which is a problem in itself) with risk and success? are you saying that the ""smarter"" someone is, the more risk they should be taking and will hence get rewarded (eventually)? 

also, what is a ""high-risk"" job? or a no-risk job? 

is the assumption that most ""indian parents"" have surplus money sitting around that they can invest willingly in high-risk-jobs that their offspring/others want to undertake, but they don't?

maybe i'll understand better if this is clarified. because sharma ji ka beta. [deleted] we have more to lose. becoming destitute in a western country is better than becoming destitute in india. americans are taught to take risks from the onset .. we're not , we lead a far more shielded life ..9 to 5 may same routine nd mundane , but atleast there's food on the plate at the end of the day if you are born in a low financial status family, then 9-5 job becomes more important as the entire family is dependent on you. one cannot imagine to take risks for that given situation. i don't have the stats but majority of indians fall into this category. forget about debts. **who the fuck will give money for simple day to day expenses if the venture fails?** what if parents aren't financially secure? it is easy to say things like this. we know only about successful people. for every bill gates and mark zuckerberg, there are thousands of failed entrepreneurs. i feel you. i took a risk and skipped going to college because i just can't bother myself to mug up shit and be in an institutionalized way of learning. so i just started with an internship and moved onto freelancing. no regrets only masti. it's a process (according to me) .. i believe our generation or the next generation will be more passionate to start something of their own in comparison to our parents .. 

plus, being from a ""banaya"" family (i know castism is shit) but i don't know i never thought of 9-5 job as an option ever (as i haven't seen my father do the same + genes may be working towards the same too) 

also, unemployment rates are pretty high.... if i don't get succeeded, i might starve to death .. starting a start up and running it successfully 
and then creating a full fledged corporation are very different things. 

just look at byju it took him almost a decade  to create a successful company. also if you're not from tier-1 institution no vc gives a shit about you.

Deepfriedpakoda,2020-04-14,AskIndia,20,48,False,"i was recently reading ""india is no longer india"" ([https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/exile-in-the-age-of-modi/609073/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/exile-in-the-age-of-modi/609073/)) and it honestly made me very uncomfortable. given how well written this piece is i passed this around a few friends and one of them happened to be a huge supporter of modizi.   


now he fired back with this piece ""[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/cogito-ergo-sum/aatish-taseer-symbolizes-the-mothering-evil-of-the-left/](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/cogito-ergo-sum/aatish-taseer-symbolizes-the-mothering-evil-of-the-left/)"".   
so my question is simple, as someone with not much inept knowledge of politics how do i comprehend and digest information when every out there  sounds convincing and at times even paste references from the by gone era ? a normal reader (novice) will find it hard to cross verify and then analyse, history is like a rabbit hole.   
 i know perception of an issue/topic is personal but my question today is how do i ge a holistic look at any given situation thats happening within our country ?",which side should i choose ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0w3qd/which_side_should_i_choose/," to think critically, the first thing you need to do is read both pieces.

then you have to dissect each article. identify their claims.

then use your knowledge of history and the context the piece is written in to scrutinise each claim. go at it with a scalpel, so to speak. if you find yourself unfamiliar with the topics being raised and the themes being discussed, then start doing research on these topics.

for me personally both articles are largely full of hot air, and of not much significance outside of intellectual masturbation.

while taseer has a claim in that he has held pio/oci status for decades in spite of his pakistani origin, it is also a fact that clerical error by the government is not an excuse to bestow unauthorised privileges to any individual ineligible for them.

on the other hand, singh plays the ""what about pakistan and the uk"" card, aka *tu quoque* or the appeal to hypocrisy fallacy to discredit taseer's claims. after all, india's actions should be reactionary to what pakistan or the uk are doing and there are no better standards than these two countries if we do have to compare. i don't think an op-ed should lead you to form your mind on anything. if that was the case then aatish taseer's post is more articulate, less hateful and obviously more credible. 

evaluate the facts, and let your own sentiments guide you. do you agree or disagree with the people who are saying these things and if so, why ? considering the hit piece on aatish reads like a  juvenile retort with shit like 

> aatish taseer is both indian and pakistani and neither; neither hindu nor muslim, but also both; colored, immigrant in the west; an exotic dream of all the feminists; male and female; of every democracy where universities are factories for pumping out legions of social justice warriors.

i don't see any reason to take it seriously. the critic is crying out why mr. taseer is not criticizing pakistan. the article taseer wrote is about india. taseer grew up in india and had indian residency papers until recently. why should he talk about pakistan? maybe he will if he writes an article about pakistan. the critic is not addressing the points taseer is raising but rather going on about leftists.

if your critic starts calling you some ""ist"", that is a minus point for him, because rather than address your argument, they place you in a group and then attack you with all the malice they have for that group. read both sides (left and right) but don't choose sides.
as facts remain facts but the narration differs.
there is no law in history that benefits some without harming some. article one points to a problem. article two is an ad-hominem on the author of article one. which one do you think you should lean on? >	i’ve never thought much of aatish taseer.

yet you came up with a poorly-written essay on him. i don't know about the aatish taseer guy, but the toi blog is hilarious.
>and then it all went wrong. having won most of everything it fought for, but unable to be in any state of mind except one of self-righteous outrage against the evil of the oppressor, decided that justice wouldn’t be achieved till the evil white man was be destroyed, along with his history, his culture, his place of honor in the fabric of the world. bring on the immigrants. bring on muslims. bring on every colored person from everywhere in the world, however they can make it. fill the west with them, bury the white man’s society and the world he built, bury it under the swarm of foreign cultures who will never agree on anything among themselves except to be allowed to keep coming, and to take whatever opportunities of money and power that can be taken from the white man.  
democracy has been turned into the ultimate weapon to destroy the societies that birth democracies. the strategy is simple, import so many people who’ll have the vote but will not subscribe to the white man’s culture, history, or values, and will simply vote them out of existence.

well what do you know, this guy is a white nationalist. even fox news would be hesitant to publish this.

>aatish taseer, arundhati roy, these are all limousine marxists. for whatever marx got right, what he got wrong was that the working class has no identity, or should have no identity, other than an economic one: labor. this lays the seed of a “secular” ideology that is different from the secularism enshrined in the american constitution.  
american secularism is the separation of church and state. but where it protects the state from religious law, it also protects freedom of belief and conscience from persecution or manipulation by the state. that is true secularism. marxist secularism however does not seek a separation between belief and state. the marxist ideal is an ideological state, and the ideology tolerates no rivals. while the marxist working class rights origins of the left have disappeared, marxism has mutated and switched from economics to culture. now the ideology is that the christian white men, hindu nationalists and zionists are the oppressors, and their victims are righteous in uniting in revolution.

and as always, these people haven't read marx but like to think they know everything about him. as far as i know, arundhati roy is a social democrat and aatish taseer is a liberal, none of them espouse marxism. looks like this guy has been reading those ""cultural marxism"" conspiracies out there.
>the marxist dna of oppressor and oppressed has jumped from the soul of the soviet union over to the west following the fall of the berlin wall.

[oppressor vs oppressed is an explicitly non-marxist way of thinking](https://libcom.org/library/gaspar-miklos-tamas-telling-truth-about-class). marx doesn't look at capitalism as a caste system where evil rich people steal from virtuous poor individuals, but rather as a system where capital kind of takes on a life of its own and where someone being a capitalist only really means that they are a 'conscious representative' of the logic of capital flow. from capital vol 1:

>""...looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist.""

so it's not like the capitalist class are an oppressing group that imposes their will on the oppressed proletariat, but instead both are subject to the logic of the system itself. to be able to see the truth you need to build up scientific temperament. that plus a good store of knowledge. no other way around it. 

until you are able to identify problem areas in data being presented yourself, you will feel like a football being kicked around.

the best way around things is to load up on peer reviewed, scientifically vetted data. a lot of people think scientific method is limited to stem but it is not. studies on classism, casteism, discrimination etc use the scientific method to produce verifiable and testable conclusions. all that is needed is your time and effort. i'm happy you are asking such questions instead of just taking a side and defending it without truly understanding it.

my suggestion would be in addition to the other good advice you received here is to not take a permanent side. approach each issue in isolation and understand all angles before forming an opinion or stance. both sides can be wrong or unjust. neither is infallible. 

it just so happens that the current govt is skating too close to the border we call fascism. so many people find it difficult to show support to such a govt when the flipside of the coin is drenched in blood and hatred. never stick to any political party, never stick to any ideology.

i have booked appointment with doctor. i will be meeting with him at 6.30pm. thanks for all the suggestions.
many of you suggesting to call an ambulance. but it makes situation messy in our apartment. the day government officials came to stick the quarantine sticker ,all the neighbours and apartment people got panicked. if an ambulance come they will decide that i am covid_19 positive.

inform the doc what time you're coming.
carry a hand sanitizer.  
dont touch your phone until you sanitize.   
dont touch anything and wear a mask if u have one. 
sanitize before and after exiting the hospital.

mutual consent divorce can be filed without a lawyer. however, i'll advise against it, simply because it'll take you double the time and effort to figure out everything on your own. 

you need to file one mutual consent divorce petition. go through compulsory counseling. and then present yourself before the judge. 

this takes about 6-8 months. 

you can do this without informing your parents as they aren't required at any stage. lawyer here.

it can be done without a lawyer but i would advice against it. if its a mutual divorce, approach a lawyer who practices in family law and they should be able to do it for relatively cheap. it will save you a lot of hassle. however, if you still choose to do it without a lawyer, approach the family court in your city and ask for the admin of the court.

subject to your circumstances, divorce can be easily filed in your resident state. that will depend on your specific circumstances and, if you're going without a lawyer, the court admin will be able to assist you.

can assist you if you have any more questions. you can dm whenever. [legal advice india](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladviceindia/) like the two lawyers have said, it is a fairly easy process but it will take a minimum of 6 to 8 months.

hiring a lawyer will make it much easier. it is a simple application and lawyers should not charge much for it. plus, once the application is filed in the court, the lawyer will not be required anymore so you will only be paying the lawyer for the initial application. go to a young (er) lawyer since it is not a complicated matter and he/she will be cheap.

you will have to file it in the place you guys live or got married. if you want to file it in another city, you will have to say you got married there. but that would be lying on oath so i would advise against that.

&#x200b;

if you are intent on doing it on your own, read section 13b of the hindu marriage act and draft a petition accordingly. just logically, why would 2 adults need to inform their parents about their actions? you don't need to inform them when you take a loan or buy a house. always get a lawyer. and tell everyone who will be impacted in any way by the decision. divorces are anyway complicated and messy on many levels, mutual or contested. no reason to add to that. i am reminded of the marriage story film. they decide that they don't need lawyers and then wife gets an expensive shrewd lawyer. protect yourself, dude. hi everyone, just asking. how often do the mandatory counselling sessions happen? what if i am an nri and my wife remains in india. does that complicate things? what is the need of alimony in this case? to whom is it going to , you or her? both parties need to hire lawyers, you have to file a matrimonial suit. your lawyer will present the case. cases will get adjourned few times.

1. indians are indispencible.

2. indians won't complain

3. even if there is a fuck up, companies can pay their way out of trouble. amazon bangalore employee here, we have wfh till end of the month. because india [deleted] my employer has made wfh mandatory for all our employees worldwide at least for the next two weeks. indians are very adjustable. even if it costs their life. 1.3 billion after all because situation does not seem so serious here ( at least according to news media and government). infact virus seems to be only through imported cases if the govt is to be believed. that's why companies don't see need to wfh 1 more thing i have observed that, people in middle management are more relyctant to do wfh, beacuse they are vulnerable when they are not present in ofc micromanaging the shit out of employees, most of them arn't relevant...


i mean a ofc decalred that they will give 40% employee wfh on rotational basis, now that is bullshit, beacuse this is not going to take out the risk... we all need to isolate ourself for 2 3 week to flaten the curve of spread. i'm pro-wfh, but my experience has taught me to ensure that it's not misused.

pentacle555,2020-04-09,AskIndia,30,29,False,"at the risk of sounding anti-national and conservative, i admit to watching a show called ""qurban"" in last 2 days. i don't even remember how i came across it. i didn't realise it was pakistani show for a while. but damn, it was addictive. it was not even that great a show but very watchable. i am the person who always watched shows like house md / game of thrones / westworld ...and kind of ridiculed indian shows (still do) but i didn't dislike qurban. it was different from what i have been watching in general. i found few dialogues very powerful, deep and meaningful in the show. maybe they turned more beautiful because of the heavy urdu words. and at times, i found the show depicting reality as well. characters were not black and white. they had their own grey behaviour. it was dramatized but not too overdone. plus all the actors were not bad at their jobs. they were also treat to the eyes. 😅 i was shocked to find myself hooked to the show. just wanted to know if someone has seen pakistani shows here? i remember that ""zindagi gulzar hai"" was very famous.",have you ever watched pakistani daily soaps?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxzzft/have_you_ever_watched_pakistani_daily_soaps/," my mother used to watch them on zindagi channel. the stories were good/great but were so depressing and tragic that my mother got depressed. 

thankfully that channel closed down due to nationalist propaganda back in the days of dd, many people in northern india loved pakistani soaps, they were far better written with much more nuanced characters.

not sure when indian viewership ebbed away, but i suspect satellite tv and a subsequent ban on pakistani channels had something to do with it. still, zee started a channel dedicated to pakistani soaps as recently as 2014 (until 2016).

while personally i can’t get into *any* soaps, (even something like *the affair*), some of my friends really like pakistani soaps as a refreshing change from indian tv. dont know about shows but i listen to pakistani music and in contact with few youtubers and photographers. dude they're amazing artists. pakistani shows are really good and they are now what indian shows used to be back in 90s.

strong female characters

no ""dhoom tananananan""

no ""vamp"" with industrial makeups

no sleeping in jwellery and saree

story that people could relate to

no 5 cut from every angle of each family member till the episode ends

story arc that had an end and was not
 stretched.

and you know whom to blame for this degradation. i strongly recommend udaari. it's about child sexual abuse. pretty spot on drama, one of my favourite. 
other than that i have watched zindagi gulzar hai, humsafar, maat, baaghi.

maat and baaghi are good. i loved zindagi gulzar hai when i watched it the first time, second time watch made me feel that the story line is somewhat hypocritical and sexist. i don't like humsafar, cheesy for my liking.

but do watch udaari, i totally recommend it.
serious theme, strong but realistic characters, no deviation from main theme ,sisterhood, solidarity and feminism- a rare thing to find in tv shows. not me but my mom watches them. but from what even i have seen those; miles better than these shitty indian ones. the best part is that their story is usually contained in around 35-40 episodes, maybe less. if u want, after this show u have been watching, my personal recommendation would be 'ahd-e-wafa'. watched 'maat' a long time ago and liked it. i travel a bit (a lot) and use to watch the k-dramas (korea soaps) in spanish or the brazilian telenovelas in romanian.  they make as much sense as any of the other soaps. the language was irrelevant. i've watched one pak series called 'mann ke moti' and it was really good. i'd recommend you to look at 2-3 episodes and then judge it. after the abrogation of 370 i was bored to death,  my neighbour got me hooked up on pakistani serials during lockdown. at first i was reluctant to watch them, then later on i got to know what i am actually missing out. stories that can relate to real case scenario.

there was a similar thread a while ago with some really good advice, please do go through it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/evlval/my_father_just_passed_away/ the first thing to do would be to get a death certificate. a basic guide about getting a death certificate : http://lawtimesjournal.in/what-is-the-legal-formality-to-be-carried-out-after-a-person-is-dead/
however i would still suggest you to get the help of a lawyer to decide the next steps regarding the company, any outstanding loans etc. if a person expires, his liabilities will be balanced against his assets. it means his loans will be paid out of his assets, not yours. if you are not inheriting his belongings, you are in no way responsible for any of his loans. if he has loans, contact a lawyer who will approach a court to establish an estate and pay off loans. if the estate or the sum total of his assets is less than the sum total of his loans, the creditors will bear a loss. if the sum total of his assets exceed the sum total of his loans, the balance of the estate or the remainder after his loans are paid off, will be inherited by the heir.

a private limited company lives on regardless of the death of it's directors. remember, a private limited company has limited liability, hence any credits or loans on the company will be paid out of the company's assets only. there has been a supreme court guideline against this however, be sure to consult a lawyer or a ca be clear on this. the closing of a private limited company is a legally complex and time consuming affair. contact a ca and get the process starts as soon as possible. you will need the consent of all the directors for this. very sorry, been through this. more strength to you and your family. hope this will help

1. death certificate (extremely important) you will need to get one certified by your doctor first. next the certificate/letter from the place where his last rights were done. all this is essential to get the dc from the corporation.
2. check all banks , assets , properties for nomination. check if your dad made a will. if this is there it will also have the directives for handling the office, company assets.
3. transferring all the shares, + above in next legal heir/spouse and ensuring nominees in all.
4. check all investments, usually if there is a joint account holder you will get these details from her/him as they will be able to fetch bank statements. also if their are documents in the house. lic and insurance schemes need to be closed .. if you have an agent then he/she will be able help. else check the procedure on the companys website.

these are trying times, take it slow. however dc is of utmost importance to get done on priority basis. reach out to lawyer friends, or most probably your dad might have a contact since he owned a firm. check his visiting cards or recall if he spoke of any lawyer friends. take support from his ca as well sorry for your loss. did he pass away with or without a will? assuming there is a will and depending on which city you reside you may have to get the will probated from a court. due to covid-19 pandemic, this will take longer than normal. check whether he has any insurance, if yes that would be helpful in clearing some liabilities if not they will be balanced from his assets. now if that asset is something like a house land etc and you don't want to lose it then you'll have to clear off the loan. sorry for your loss.

1. most important to get is death certificate.

a. you should been given death certificate if you're father passed away in hospital

b. if in home, you need to get a notary done

c. cremation certificate - this is also very important and no duplicates will be given.

c. the hospital should voluantarily send dc to the muncipality under which the hospital registered. if not ask them to do it.

d. once you they do, you need to submit both dc & cremation certificate along with few forms at the municpality. wait for 10 to 15 days (could bribe to get even faster), you'll get the certificate approved municipality certificate.

rest you can read what /user/cncrndctzn2. sorry for your loss. my dad passed away last month.

this is the time to rely on others around you. talk to the place he worked at and inform everyone by phone. make sure his office hr or equivalent department processes the death.

you won't be able to process anything much else right now. the death certificate will take some time to arrive and you need it for most things. if you don't have political clout, you'll probably need to give bribe at the crematorium to get it faster.

regarding the company, don't try to take the responsibility on yourself. your only job now is to grieve and be with your family. trust me, during such times people will step in and help. you will have a tough time for the first set of days. don't be shy to lean on friends and family. yes loans become your responsibility.

raghav48,2020-03-16,AskIndia,36,581,False,"life becomes unbearable without the love and affection of the family members and the belongingness of society. unfortunately for kumarinayak, a 63-year-old woman from the ganjan district of odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has polydactylism.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. in the case of kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

kumari said in an interview: ‘i was born with this defect and i couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

as she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. she feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

it has now been 63 years that i have had this condition. she said in the interview, ‘the residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that i am a witch and keep away from me. they sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘i am forced to stay indoors as i am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

one of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. and, kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

on hearing kumari’s situation, government officials of india have decided to come to her aid. she is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

in 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. even though the government of india is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

muybien768,2020-04-12,AskIndia,13,72,False,"hi everyone, i know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment. but one of my closest friends is stuck in delhi (kalkaji, south delhi). he was returning from ranchi to his home in noida after giving an interview there. unfortunately, when he returned to delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. and up border as well as delhi was sealed. consequently, he could not reach noida and had to settle for getting a pg room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .he tried asking for police help from both delhi and up police, but no help. now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  rs. 1200/night. and with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. all his savings are nearly finished. i tried to help whatever little i could financially. and hoped that lockdown would end on april 14 and he might move back to his home. but now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

i will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. if someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. he can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

as i said, i know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. but i am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. if it helps, he was already screened for covid at delhi airport and was tested negative. also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms. if someone can help, please send me a dm.",help needed for a friend in coronavirus crisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzy79t/help_needed_for_a_friend_in_coronavirus_crisis/," if someone was managing ~ 1000*18 = 18000 rs for accommodation then noway he is poor , also airport screening is only for fever .. no real test . ask him to contact proper authorities for cheaper / free accommodation + food .

UtopianSoldier,2020-04-10,AskIndia,50,9,False,"in some parts of india, it's only stray dogs. but in some part in the north, we are blessed with both stray dogs and monkey 

here is the problem. they don't live peacefully like birds. dogs bark and make it impossible for you to walk esp at night. sometimes they even bite you. you cannot take a walk in your street at night these days anymore. they pretty much terrorize you.

people have died and even fall off from the roof because of sudden monkey attacks. monkeys destroy the public property esp cable system, cause faults and scare kids the most. we used to sleep on the roof at night when we were kids but it impossible to do because of all these monkeys terrorizing us.

i see people feeding them and effectively increasing their number which makes my blood boil. i feel people should stop feeding them. they all should be locked and taken to the jungle and left there forever. 

in civilized cities, there is no place for stray animals. if you disagree, tell me one reason why we shouldn't bring all other animals like deer, sheep, goats and have them live here? can you imagine how it would be then?

what are your opinions about this situation?","how should we solve the stray dogs, monkey problem in india",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fyg8td/how_should_we_solve_the_stray_dogs_monkey_problem/," the issue is the loss of habitat. given an option, a monkey never chooses to live near an apartment complex or cables. the trees they live on are cut down and they intrude. for dogs, sterilisation is a must and some cities do a good job of it. 
for monkeys, maybe catch them and send them off to religious sites. i see many temples with monkeys peacefully coexisting. monkeys - easy. create more wild spaces. india anyway needs much much more of green areas. plant trees that can provide food for the monkeys. and better the environment too. 

dogs - most strays are more like public pets, which are fed by the neighborhood. designate 1-2 people from each street to impart the dogs basic training. untrained/misbehaved dogs are a nuisance, but well-behaved/trained dogs are a delight! it is really very easy to get dogs to behave. they have coexisted with humans for millenia. 

if dogs bark too much at night, throw small stones at them while they are barking - so they get the message that barking invites stones. >in civilized cities, there is no place for stray animals. 

its not  very civilised to encroach wild habitat for building cities and then think that humans are the only ones with right to live. dogs don't like people like you. if you get scared and try to run off, they will go after you. in circumstances where you are surrounded by the dogs, stand your ground or you will regret it. 

this is india. in hinduism, people think they that they would be cursed if they harm an animal. this is absolutely correct. humans and social animals coexist with each other. all my neighboring street dogs are my friend. heck, i feel like a king walking down the streets as the dogs walk by me. 

monkeys, however are a totally different league of animals. they are absolute assholes and will destroy a thing if they can. but since they relate to lord hanuman, they are well-respected and feared animals in this country. kill some humans and give them back their habitat they'll stop bothering you in normal countries , the animals would be rounded up and put in enclosures or shelters .

but in india , if you try to do it , the government , ngo , media , social media arm chair activists will come shrieking after you .

they are okay with people dying from rabies and these stray animals making the life hell for everyone , but god forbid if the government does its duty to round them up and get rid of stray animals second comment in this thread - 

the way humans treat defenseless (against human offensive) creatures is directly reflective and predictive of the way humans treat each other. 

once we start with *eradicating* the animals now. in a few years, it will be normal to simply *eradicate* the slum-dwellers who live in filth and uglify our cities. in a few more decades, it could even normal to *eradicate* humans that have outlived their perceived (in the eyes of whoever has their finger on the button) utility. *genocide* i'm totally for ridding our streets of stray dogs. people coming out in the early mornings to feed these strays! do you even realize how dangerous some of these dogs are to kids? and any time talk of euthanizing them comes up, there are a bunch of activists who talk about being humane and cancel the plan. i'm sorry, but if i see a dog potentially hurting my loved ones or anyone for that matter, i would have no qualms in it being captured and handled in whatever way required. if the activists can take all the strays home and keep them, it would be great too. we don't need dogs on the street.  
i haven't seen any monkeys around where i've lived, so can't comment on that. but i presume that's a nuisance too.", None juliechamp HerculePorotta dumbadmins PretendExplanation1 ParmanuMan juliechamp HeresyLight,solve stray dogs monkey problem parts stray dogs part north blessed stray dogs monkey problem live peacefully birds dogs bark make impossible walk esp night sometimes bite you cannot take walk street night days anymore pretty much terrorize you died fall roof sudden monkey attacks monkeys destroy public property esp cable system cause faults scare kids most used sleep roof night kids impossible monkeys terrorizing us see feeding effectively increasing number makes blood boil feel stop feeding them locked taken jungle left forever civilized cities place stray animals disagree tell reason bring animals deer sheep goats live here imagine would then opinions situation
naigonlassun,2020-04-03,AskIndia,37,65,False,"i am from a family that is not full of hardcore bhatks per se but of people who believe strongly in the whatsapp forwards that do the rounds. recently, i was in my family whatsapp group, which said something about how awesome the 9 am 9 minute announcement thing is because of astrology and shit. i replied in the group with a funny arnab gif and everyone dismissed it. to make things worse, another unkill sent another video about some doctor explaining scientifically how this astrologically thought out move will help drive away the coronavirus in our country. if you ask me, by believing in messages like these instead of our medical and security personnel, who are putting their bodies on the line to fight covid-19 for us, is utterly disrespectful and stupid. plain idiotic. because of all this, my anxiety levels increase and i feel pathetic to be a part of such people who believe in this bull crap of 9 am, 9 times = mangal and all this shit.   
how do you guys deal with this seriously? i mean it hurts me a lot and i get really sad at times. how do i cope with this?",is there any way out of this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu89th/is_there_any_way_out_of_this/," i never talk politics with my bhakt relatives and friends. talk about anything other than politics and current affairs with them and your mind will be in peace, that is if you value the relationship. i have gradually cut the hardcore bhakts from my life because they contribute absolutely nothing to my life. play hamlet. when they talk corona, post regarding badminton. when namo, post about otters mating. do your own thang. 😈 many like you.
just mute that group and ignore them. you cannot argue with people who do not value facts. that's it. just learn to avoid them. mock the idiots. you have to engage them in a conversation.

for this, first you have to educate yourself about the modern scientific and rational tradition. this goes beyond merely mugging up scientific facts! also, understand our own native philosophical traditions. you should read up on the history and philosophy of modern science, and also on our own classical modes of looking at reality. why or why not are these two incompatible? where is the actual difficulty here?

you must also learn the basics of presenting our arguments clearly and rationally. this works best when we approach people not with a snobbish attitude, but with a genuine desire to understand why they believe the things they do. once we understand clearly how they justify their beliefs, we can better attack their positions.

finally, note that we ourselves could be wrong. ""reality is not only stranger than what we suppose, but it is stranger than what we can suppose"". who knows, maybe astrology etc. will turn out to have some substance in ways that we cannot today foresee. so a bit of intellectual humility helps. join them, blast them with stupid facts make them realise how stupid they all really are i think this is a phase we are going through as a result of poor democratic decisions. india, in hindsight will realize this maybe 10-20 years later. you or me cannot change these people. they will be like this until they die. what we can do is to try to raise a generation who are sensible enough. better times will come. by getting depressed, keeping myself occupied with whatever i can, losing it occasionally, make myself and others miserable. rinse, repeat. there is absolutely nothing to be done. you and i are trained to use logic as a tool to discern truth from untruth. they aren't. that's why no amount of logic will make sense to them.

it's because they speak a different language than us. to them, it's all about emotion. not logic. all that 9 times 9 mangal bullshit, is what they've been trained since childhood to recognise.

the only way to get through to them is through the emotional shock of people they care about dying around them. till then, nothing will get through. increasingly, your family is not your family


it's whatsapp influenced- you cant be there all the time, while the phone can.

&#x200b;

3. it is verifying your mobile number with otp, all data are uploaded with aes 256 encryption and the encryption key and data may be sold to anyone ready to pay $$$$ like aadhaar scam linked transaction.

there's nothing wrong with extensive localisation, allows your app to reach a wider target audience.

>code is obfuscated

pretty standard practice, atleast on the web. you obfuscate your code when you don't want people to find out what your code does, so that people have difficulty understanding and cloning it (i suppose).

>someone seems to have changed package name to nic.goi.aarogyasetu and sold it to our government for 100000 usd?

what makes you think government directly hired someone for the job. they simply contacted someone who could do it and paid them to do it. https://internetfreedom.in/a-comprehensive-look-at-covid-surveillance-and-privacy-in-india/

pg 59 of the working paper talks about arogya setu app. how is the app supposed to know if you have been in contact with a covid-19 patient if your screen is off, bluetooth pairing is not automatic (so it can find devices that are amber or red in risk status) and if it wants to save your precise location for track back? by magic? i am a big sceptic of this government and the invasion of privacy with this app.

i was dead against it until i saw the vox video about the success s korea had with contact tracing. they were one of the frontrunners of this pandemic in march but have flattened the curve remarkably well with exhaustive testing and contact tracing. heck, i think india has more cases than them, now.

contact tracing becomes even more critical in india given the idiots who are using this lockdown period to go play cricket.

as much as i hate this app, i have still installed it and hope many folks do so, too. i know i can uninstall when this sars-cov-2 threat is behind us.

as /u/drunkzookeeper has said, these invasive permissions are required to build a social map and understand who has been in the same vicinity as someone who's tested positive. 

how else would you know whether you have crossed paths with an infected person at your local sabzi mandi?

folks, i can completely understand your discomfort and scepticism. i fight that battle internally every day. but an app like this works only if we have a large enough population using it. suspend your anger (as correct as it is to have it) temporarily. 

the need of the hour is to give as much useful information as possible to central authorities so that they have adequate data on which to base decisions.

please do consider installing and self-testing in this app. please do have everyone who will be in close proximity to you in the days to come understand this app and have them consider installing it.

i_try_my_best_okay,2020-03-23,AskIndia,88,38,False,many indians are avoiding chicken although it's been repeated a million times that corona can't spread through well cooked food. people are so ignorant.,why are indian people not eating chicken?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnd628/why_are_indian_people_not_eating_chicken/," not only chicken, people have stopped feeding eggs to their kids..

ha animal milk is ok, no corona there.../s

at the end of all this mess we will have a generation of protein deficient kids...

good, we will get chicken at cheap prices.

on the other hand one day these idiots will get eggs and chicken banned by modiji, so enjoy while you can.

it has nothing to do with corona/food science  people are tagging their caste habits to a disease, half of india now secretly thinks untouchability was the right thing..we might start getting whatsapp messages soon on caste-discrimination is besht.. there's a fake rumor on whatsapp that chicken causes coronavirus.

good news is, prices have dropped a lot.

but people could stop selling chicken entirely so that could be messed up. china also just culled a large amount of birds due to avian flu (i think it is). maybe that’s normal practice - can’t be too careful at the moment. i avoid farm-bred chicken (broilers) - to avoid the yuuge quantities of antibiotics that goes into those. 

nothing to do with corona. 

properly cooked chicken won't give you the bird flu either. 

the current disaster in the poultry markets is just cuz of paranoia + ignorance. same as people peddling tulsi leaves, etc. mainly out of fear from bird flu (which has been reported from kerala, i think), but of course, also because of general fear based on the covid-19 infection originally coming from meat, and that information being mangled by the geniuses who run india's whatsapp university. i'm from mysore, and there's this bird flu in karnataka kerala region. don't know about rest of the india though reason why i am not eating: https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bird-flu-cases-add-to-the-woes-of-poultry-rearers/article31093908.ece hey i am , bought 5 kilos just yesterday >_> 1. fake news about covid-19 being spread by it.

2. there are also cases of birdflu which are found in philippines, kerala and some other palaces.

second is what people should be worried now not the first. i'll add the link for birdflu. don't know about other parts of india, but here in calicut there has been cases of birdflu and many chicken and birds (including pets) were killed last week.

_onan,2020-03-30,AskIndia,59,31,False,"india has different personal laws for hindus, muslims and christians, due to which india is not completely ""secular"".","why is there an opposition to a uniform civil code in india, even though a nation can only be truly secular if all its citizens are subject to the same laws and no discrimination is done by the state on the basis of religion?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frm03w/why_is_there_an_opposition_to_a_uniform_civil/," i'm not against ucc, but i'm curious how a government that imposes beef ban based on beliefs followed by certain sects of hindus to non-hindus as well will go about implementing it. my concern is that they aren't fans of secularism yet are very pro-ucc, which sounds paradoxical and makes me wonder what the motivation is, if that makes sense. lift beef ban. you can't allow special treatment for some religious laws. firstly, the civil code defines the relationships between two or more individuals and not the relationship between an individual and the state. the lack of an uniform civil code doesn't mean that there is any discrimination on the basis of religion when it comes to the relationship between the state and an individual.

secondly, it would be difficult to impose a civil code in india due to the huge variation of beliefs and customs among communities within the country. for example, marriages between close cousins are common in parts of tn, that are otherwise illegal in rest of india. if one believes that all these variations in customs should be respected, an uniform civil code is a non-starter. abhi sab thande baste mein daal diya hai. check after june 2020. uniform civil code will be a boon for indian muslims as a whole, if implemented uniformly that is. most of the muslim personal laws are bad for muslim women, thereby stopping them from progressing in the society. 50% of the demographics held back because muslim men can't let go of the power and control they have over muslim women. having laws that stop that will benefit the entire muslim community. only the regressive orthodox muslim men will lose some privilege here. 


going by the past records, the bjp government will never implement it uniformly. they'll only focus on how it can used a beating stick to harm the muslim community even more. even congress under rajiv gandhi did the same, who also toyed with gaining the support of hindutwadis, so we can't expect any better from the worse alternative. as  usual, there is no discussion as to what this ucc would be?
just stating that there should be, does not matter much and given past and current bjp policies has to be viewed with suspicion at least. 

having separate civil codes for the religions is perhaps what makes it secular as all of the major religions are represented. 
secular does not mean lack of religion. it only means that the state does not prefer one religion over another. 
what is ucc?
explain it in more than just a one liner and then we can discuss. again this is just a fear of people. the implementation of ucc may follow the modus operandi of caa. caa alone could have been beneficial to some illegal migrants from neighbouring countries but it was coupled with nrc and hence had mass opposition. 


hence there is a fear of what may be implemented in the name of ucc. there are chances of taking away religious freedom enshrined in constitution. many countries across the world allow personal laws of each community as long as they are not going against the constitution. 

like triple talaq was made illegal as per demand of muslim women but the government also made it criminal act by introducing jail terms by the bjp on its own without any such demands from the women organisation. why? it is such actions from the government that make people wary of bjp and its aim in introducing ucc. 

btw india is not a secular nation, so maybe they should just declare it a hindu rashtra and just enshrine protection for minorities in constitution including reservation like in pakistan.", Cerebral_aqueduct foreverall1 the_S1lence freestyle50m cosmogli MainbhiBhakt zafar_bull,opposition uniform civil code though nation truly secular citizens subject laws discrimination done state basis religion different personal laws hindus muslims christians due completely secular

we own an alto 800.
we do not have an air conditioner even though temperatures regularly go above 45 degrees. 
we go out for dinner once in two-three months.

we don't have a tv.
we don't have a wifi connection only mobile data.

why am i posting this because recently my friend said someone with 5 crores would have an iphone 11 a mercedes benz etc why would he even study engineering in this college. i seriously have a 14k phone literally had to beg my dad for a new one just to play pubg and everyone in my house uses a cheap 12-13k phone.
this really made me think over because i find it okayish i mean there are a few things that could be done.

your life is what should be defined as simple. i don’t think your net worth is anywhere close to what you think it is. your father is in debt that you don’t know about. while i do think the lifestyle you describe might be too frugal but it is your father's money and he gets to decide how to spend it. if you want a more expensive lifestyle, do it once you start earning. that money is accumulated by your dad by living a frugal life for years and investing a large chunk of his income. he has achieved it by not taking any debt and avoiding two money gazzlers in life - owning a house and a costly car. the balance he secured in life is for financial security. if he used to lead a flashy lifestyle then today his networth would probably be negetive. either you have become the buddha or this is some high quality shitpost to be honest yeah thats way too frugal. the best question too ask is what are you going to do with all that money begs the question what is the purpose of life. dude my dad has that ammount in bank. along with same amount of worth in property. we don't have a car and the most expensive phone is my nokia 6.1 which i bought for 7k at sale. 5 lakh cash and student? something doesn't add up. spend on items for yourself is directly related to how much you can earn and not how much you have saved.

do not look at savings as your worth. that is the banks job if you want debt.

at your level, see how much you (or father) earn. part of that earnings go in savings, main household expense and balance for personal items.

if your father has made 5cr savings by saving 10k every month then you are living as per your means. while your friend, who you are comparing with, might have a higher earning income (and lesser savings).

getting admitted to a hospital seems to be a dumb idea as there are high chances that you may get infected. please don't take that risk. you could ask for collector's or any other competent authority permission to travel. they'll hand over a signed paper with their seal. maybe ask your local phc/gh doctor if you know someone. tweet to vizag police/ap police/odisha police twitter handles. get a curfew pass or any document made after contacting local police that you have no residence or living space in odisha and you must go back to your town. i know of people who had to do this. 

chart out a route. see what districts you have to pass through. acquire curfew passes for all districts. get taxi. travel home. once you get there, give the passes to your driver so he doesn't face issues while travelling back get admitted to a hospital. foods meant for people suffering from lock down are not reaching the real victims. declare bankruptcy. be a burden on administration.

we then purchased the second generation mi vaccum cleaner from xiaomi and it definitely beats the roomba we had in terms of noise and battery life. spares is still an issue but alibaba has some trustworthy sellers so it's not an issue if we order in a month advance. not to mention, the spares are cheaper.

we also have a irobot braava mopping robot. i would recommend it only if your house has small rooms. not at all , i own a roomba i7 and an m6 .

both have their own tantrums at random days(someday i7 would not follow it’s map while someday m6 would take hours to complete one room done) .  i would not say it is a total replacement for maids . how much does it cost? shiney ahuja? i gifted my mom with a roomba and a brava. she has scheduled roomba to run on tuesday and thursday but she she cleans the house on the weekend herself. 

the tiny brava on the other hand can’t be scheduled though it works really well on smooth surfaces. she uses brava only in the main hall as it uses a different navigation system.

but both of them does take a lot of load off. me and my wife ordered a bosch dishwasher for ourselves just a week before the lockdown. we were quite sceptical whether it will be able to clean properly or not. but to our surprise no maid can match a dishwasher wash. however you can not wash utensils made of aluminium, copper etc. i have ..does a fab job too ..very helpful at times like these.. i use eufy 11s. love it. great simple tool and does a perfect job everyday. i had gotten an i-robot roomba 966 three years ago because i have two cats and fur does *not* get swept up by a broom. it's been going strong since then and i run it almost daily. cleans my 2bhk in an hour well enough that i can walk without slippers and not feel any grit on my feet. i just have to make sure that there's not water or any cat toys on the floor before running it because they get trapped in it's brushes and i have to clean them up.

it's seriously a life-saver. they've launched new models recently with washable filters now and xiaomi has one that even mops. i'm tempted to upgrade to the xiaomi one in the future! my xiaomi robot vacuum works better and more efficiently than any human ever could. so definitely.

I_can_believe_that,2020-04-11,AskIndia,21,22,False,"i mean, in south korea they started community testing during 1st week of march, when one infected woman visited church, that single incident alone lead to 7,000 cases. 

when germany and other european countries started implementing community testing their cases spiked up to over 100,000 in a matter of days, each day they got over 5000 cases. 

that’s true for community testing in any country, a single person can spread to 100s of other people.

some people might argue that we’ve lockdown....but in india, we’ve had several major incidents before the lockdown, which increased our cases, yet we’re getting only few 100s of cases each day. 

even kerala government is continuously saying they’re testing aggressively, then why aren’t we seeing any results? why kerala isn’t having over 10,000 cases by now if they’re testing for community transmission? 

our low number of cases make it seem like we aren’t doing anything close to community testing...","if india has started aggressive community testing, then why our cases are only increasing by mere 300-500 everyday?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz4s5q/if_india_has_started_aggressive_community_testing/," simple, we haven't started aggressive testing! lemme clear your doubt with an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s77yawln0xa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s77yawln0xa)

you are welcome. i agree testing is low.  we cant do what germany and south korea is doing. see it is easy to get angry on govt. we dont have enough testing kits or money. but we might just have dodged the bullet. assume that virus is wide spread like western countries. then why dont we see rush in hospitals? its not that easy to hide. even 60-70% cases are asymptomatic in mumbai. it looks like it has not exploded so far like west. fingers crossed though. but there is surely something. either they are hiding dead bodies or something is really working for us. temperature , our exposure to bacteria/viruses due to unhyginic condition or bcg vaccine or young population.  or just maybe lock down timing was good. one more thing to consider india is not that mobile. we dont have too many tourist to and from china.either way one thing is clear picture is not complete. see tests relative to population size. it's still one of the lowest in the world. i think no other country in the whole world can compare themselves to south korea. they had a perfect answer to everything which was because they made use of the experience gained during a previous outbreak. they mass produced test kits very early and more importantly they sacrificed privacy of citizens to do contact tracing. 95 percent of their citizens have smart phones and government could get their location data. govt is doing image management but not forthcoming with granular data about the tests. safe to assume they are doing jack shit. san changa si very likely the governments are just incompetent or fudging numbers. could also be that because the lockdown was called a bit earlier in the outbreak - the infected patients are not spreading it as much. could also be other factors like bcg immunity or the virus lasting shorter on surfaces because of higher temps. because mudiji you can say india has started testing now! we have tested only 19k in a city like mumbai so we can just imagine! just because the numbers are low it doesnt mean we are doing a good job. someone had posted this in some other thread ‘india has the best policy against covid, low tests low numbers, everyone happy, aal is well’", _drimzy chase_away_the_night pratikub skywalker2939 vikram612g dhakkarnia skywalker2939 plowman_digearth SabBarabar vraoz,started aggressive community testing cases increasing mere 300 500 everyday mean south korea started community testing 1st week march infected woman visited church single incident alone lead 7 000 cases germany european countries started implementing community testing cases spiked 100 000 matter days day got 5000 cases that true community testing country single person spread 100s might argue we ve but we ve several major incidents increased cases yet we re getting 100s cases day kerala continuously saying they re testing aggressively aren t seeing results kerala isn t 10 000 cases they re testing community transmission low number cases make seem aren t anything close community testing

> in an investigation of the content being shared on whatsapp and apps like tiktok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the delhi police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> an analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in hindi and urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> the videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by ndtv. according to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""several of these videos appear to be shot in pakistan and middle east but audio in hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in india,"" the 22-page report, which the delhi police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> according to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""while analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among muslims are promoting pakistani religious leaders with terror links. a further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> according to the investigation, chinese-owned video sharing app tiktok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. these videos are further being shared on whatsapp, facebook and twitter.

> videos of muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.

> religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.

> authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in madhya pradesh's indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in delhi because of a gathering held by a muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.

> in the investigation into the delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group tablighi jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep muslims away from fellow muslims"".

from the article :


>on searching google with the keywords ‘muslims licking plates’, we came across the same video on vimeo, uploaded on 31 july 2018 by a user called asghar vasanwala. according to the description of the video, the people seen in the video are dawoodi bohras, who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of food


>furthermore, the website of the dawoodi bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel ‘thaal’, which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people. they also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food - “bohras have a no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away”. wait till those guys see the water used in pani puris ...covid 19 is a virus that hopefully would be cured  .. communal hatred  is deep-rooted in india  ..ain't no cure for that  shit .. a friend of mine who hasn't messaged me in months randomly sent me one of these videos and said take care, because of these people we will all get sick. we need to do something about them. its utter bullshit. i'm a brahmin hindu, and i know my kin well--they'll find any germ- or health-related excuse they can to fuck over muslims. very important question. these could be staged, doctored or old, or it could be new and true. what's disturbing is that many people aren't interested in verifying the sources, and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of ""the truth"". but given the extent of hatred and division across the country, it is the question to ask. goes against the agenda though there is another video circulating where a fruit seller appears to be licking his fingers as he rearranges fruits in his cart. if there is a non-malevolent interpretation for this, please do share, as it might help to clear the air in certain forums. this also..its month old video now circulating saying corona wala police pe thuk raha

 [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhb0bx/ive_sort_of_ran_away_from_home/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is me, the guy who left home ten days back and took to this subreddit for advice. first of all, i would like to thank to everyone for taking the time out of their day and reaching out to me and lending their support. tough times we are living in, and i hope everyone is doing well. i've been well too, health wise. taking precautions to the best of my abilities. 

to give everyone an update on my situation, i did land a job in a bpo and i was expected to join from 23rd of march, but due to coronavirus scare, the joining is being delayed to 6th of next month. in the meantime, i kept looking for work but due to the situation we are in right now, all the interviews and hirings keep getting postponed and i don't see it getting better anytime soon. so here i am again, in need of suggestions and advice. to put it blatantly out there, i don't know what to do anymore. 

my parents have been panic calling me and asked me to come back home, although still very upset and angry. should i? i'm embarrassed and i don't want to face them. i left home because i had enough of being useless and i wanted to make a change. plus, there is a possibility that i have already exposed myself to the virus since i was having my meals with six hundred people everyday in gurudwara until three days back. and the dorm i'm in, almost 2/3rd people have cold and they make sure they're aren't covering their mouth at all when they sneeze. funds are getting tapered by every passing day, although i'm thankful to this kind hearted soul who don't wish to be named for helping me out with some money last time. i also don't want to stuck in delhi with everything closed and the risk of getting infected getting higher with having no money to even afford a ticket back to home. also, how risky it is to travel around right now, less for me and more for the people i expose myself to. feels like i'm stuck between rock and a hard place right now.","this is me, the guy who left home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmxlnn/this_is_me_the_guy_who_left_home/," if you are gonna travel then you have more chances of getting infected. if they don't want to wear a mask then you should get a mask and if you want to go home then go asap because the situation might get worse.

if you would ask me honestly then you should go home ""only if you want to"", but after this corona virus settles down, you should get a job, you can come back to delhi voluntarily so that your relatives and parents don't get second chance to make fun of you since you have learnt a lot of lessons in past few days you should live by those principles now. good luck. in this “corona time” i’m sure there will be folks who don’t even wanna step out for groceries. esp the old. go get groceries for them and charge for your service. you can make money even in a city in lockdown. fucks sake man. don’t listen to randos on the internet. go home. bro take care.. all i can say...and please don't hesitate to askfor anything. said it for your first post too..if i can, i will help.. and regarding gour dilemma, stay put. these testing times will eventually let you know what you're supposed to do in the end. but to get to that point, you gotta be safe.. mask khareed...stay safe..and remember, if you dont ask, you wont get.. always be brave to approach and ask.. go home kiddo . and do whatever you wanted to do after everything settles down go home man..survival is top prioriry..come back strong remember this pandemic is temporary when everything becomes normal your parent's thoughts about you also become normal what you did very is brave stay there, begin your new life on april 6th stay strong. go home or stay in a dorm, it's all fine. just stay put and stay inside. you'll be fine, it's not that deadly for your age, it just spreads incredibly wide and it spreads even when you don't show symptoms.

isolate wherever you are till this is over and do what you can online. i would say don't go to home. find jobs like putting paper it will give some money also network. i know this is difficult in this times. persevere. can we start a fund raiser for this guy? i think better option is go to  a hospital and ask for a test since u told u have doubts about you getting infected.if u are negative , next is go to your home , even though u are ashamed, still they are your family, this is time where it's really difficult to get a job for minimum 1 month as situation is still worst , so after everything clears up , go out of our home and search for job.", Neglectedsince1994 HighMenNeedHymen jioooppp 00deep00 tri___runner deusxmachine8 yadhavanyaddy hashedram throttlemaster77 4-20BlazeItMan Adventureslife,me guy left home hi this reddit r comments fhb0bx ive_sort_of_ran_away_from_home utm_medium android_app utm_source share me guy left home ten days back took subreddit advice first all would thank everyone taking day reaching lending support tough times living in hope everyone well ve well too health wise taking precautions best abilities give everyone update situation land job bpo expected join 23rd march due coronavirus scare joining delayed 6th next month meantime kept looking work due situation right now interviews hirings keep getting postponed see getting better anytime soon again need suggestions advice put blatantly there know anymore parents panic calling asked come back home although still upset angry embarrassed want face them left home enough useless wanted make change plus possibility already exposed virus since meals six hundred everyday gurudwara three days back dorm in almost 2 3rd cold make sure they re covering mouth sneeze funds getting tapered every passing day although thankful kind hearted soul wish named helping money last want stuck delhi everything closed risk getting infected getting higher money afford ticket back home risky travel around right now less expose to feels stuck rock hard place right now

it started with these vibrations will remove the virus, to thanking the medicos culminating in massive groups of people congregating in the streets to celebrate.

wah mudiji wah! 
plus i gotta commend the people who went out for this lil impromptu shindig, 

natural selection is a bitch, that's all i'm saying. it was annoying and ridiculous.

my parents banged thalis.

its one thing to do handclap which is quite silent but banging thalis ,there are old people and people who prefer silence like me and its obnoxious to hear such noise for continuous 10 mins .

rather than this,it would have been better to ask people to either donate money to health organization who are facing shortage of money.

but,people prefer to do nonsense acts rather than humane act.

next,thing we know,prime minister asks to not bath because corona may spread from water ,and people will follow it. our leaders are idiots. take care of yourself. create your own plans to survive this thing. if possible, see if you can help a couple of other people as well. dont get into unnecessary debates right now, a lot of people will be struggling in 10 days. you're right. unfortunately this is not limited to india. some people are just oblivious to the criticality of the situation. it's not the clapping that made people gather, it's their ignorance.

clapping was meant to be appreciative of the front liners and bringing sense of community. my parents were indoors all day but they refuse to carry the curfew on after today.  they tell me that everyone dies at certain point and that we cannot do much. i live with ny parents and it's so stressful. when i tried to fight them they asked me to fuck off. look my parents were at home the entire day. 

as ridiculous as it sounds, banging thalis from windows and seeing neighbouring people do the same helped put a smile on them and lifted their moods up. all the relatives were having a happy conversation on family whatsapp groups sharing pics and whatnot.

i say chalta hai yaar senior citizens ko thoda tp karne do, waise bhi bahut tense atmosphere hai aajkal. the small moments of joy are scarce and we should take it. i'm with you bauss, i was in hysterics when i saw people actually doing it , and freakin making videos of just utter chaos and posting it like a celebration. i think you missed the point of the address.
modi did not ask for people to gather in groups. he specifically said to do it from windows and balconies. it wasn't done for modi either, it was done for the people providing services. people like watchmen, public servants and delivery employees. 

if you cannot take out 5 mins to appeiciate the work put in by these people, so be it. dont judge those who do by calling it cringy.

you are not wrong to hold and opinion against modi. you can call him whatever you want, that does not make you any smarter though. you are not wrong. but you could have phrased it in a more congenial way. if you didn't care what others thought of your message, you wouldn't be here.

today almost everything has become a partisan issue. and since we don't talk face-to-face as often, we tend to be snarky and rude. practice and try to phrase messages in non-antagonistic ways and you will find that people will be more receptive, even those who don't agree.

an attempt at rephrasing below. 

>shouting while gathering in groups at 5 pm defeated the whole purpose of social distancing and public curfew. this is not how quarantine is maintained. pm modi clearly mentioned to do this in our balconies and respect social distancing. the virus can spread easily if we gather in groups. we should listen to the messages more carefully and understand the reasoning behind the suggested protocol and not blindly follow others who may be misinformed.

your take on this?",rise of india praising youtube channels,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzvi3k/rise_of_india_praising_youtube_channels/," they are just using indian population for monetary gains. many indians thirst for validation from the west. mostly due to our sense of insecurity and colonial hangover. all these channels are simply quenching that thirst. they are smart. it's very fking easy to get clicks on videos with india being either a subject or in the title. the sheer population of our country is enough to generate revenue for them. same reason why garbage third rate movies dominate bollywood. it's not about whether you are right or wrong but if you give people what they want to see then you get money. simple equation. i have watched a couple of videos from jaby's channel, it's a good channel if you like the content (i don't really like it tbh). i am not throwing shade on any one of these creators but at the end of the day if the viewers are happy and the creators are happy (and the channels don't end up hurting others directly or indirectly or spreading misinformation) it's a good time for everyone including the platform aka youtube itself. karolina goswami is the shittiest woman i have ever seen. like if you agree. comment if you don't /s for our stupid reaction (my favourite), well.. if you see they have previously tried reviewing hollywood movies. very few views. then suddenly an indian content and voila- views surging !  they went back again to hollywood but that hardly hit a four figure. so.. back to sweet subcontinent.

what's with the 3 mobile and laptop thing? you can only use ""one at a time"" oats, flattened rice, maggi taste maker and salt. you don't have to make noodles just use the taste maker on other stuff. milk powder, boost for longer shelf life. you need kellogg's cereal , milk powder , some fresh fruits for the initial days , eggs (they last for a week or so) ,bread (for the initial days), ready to eat stuff from mtr , biscuits like marie gold and parle g, rice ,dal ,oats ,tea 

it doesn't matter how much you stock up , you would have to get supplies again after a week 
i would suggest you to use big basket daily or apps like that they deliver on a regular basis before 7 am in the morning. peanut butter, any bread, some snacks. try to learn the basics of nutrition. you need carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals and fiber. most easy items only contain carbs, e.g.:

i know i would get a lot of heat for this, but i do. i suffer from a debilitating rare condition which makes every sound too painful for me, so much that i can’t even move or speak. 

and when i am in my bed laying, contemplating how my life turned out to be like this at 24 yo, and getting enough rest to face another painful day, those motherfuckers will just bark and bark and bark. 

i have tried countless things, like asking the rwa about a solution, going to animal control and they just tell me that they’ll simply steralize them but they’ll stay there. like i want them to stop barking right outside my house! ngos won’t take them because they already have so much of them.

and then i sleep in excruciating pain with no medicine and no treatment for the rest of my life. 

so sorry, fuck those stray dogs! one of my neighbors feeds the stray dogs in my street and i welcome it. they even, out of their own money, sterilized few of those dogs, while few of the remaining were sterilized by govt workers.

however, my other neighbors are always furious with them. they say that these people should stop feeding them. the arguments they make are:

* these dogs are chasing after vehicles and new people which is dangerous.
* because you are feeding, they are staying here. otherwise, they would have gone.

here is my point:

* if we stopped feeding them, they would search for food on streets. combine it with swach bharat. they may be forced to forage in drainage and dump yards. what if they get sick? what if they get worms? what if those worms somehow transfer to humans living nearby?

we have 2 options (a combination of the two can be used too):

* sterilize all stray dogs (wait for them to die off) and
  * feed them (a humane way imo)
  * stop feeding them (this may lead to unintended bad things like i said before)
* with active public and private participation, push for the adoption of these dogs
  * govt making a dedicated branch for dog related issues and give sufficient funds. ngos must also work with them.
  * create active campaigns motivating people to also adopt indigenous dog breeds.

dogs were domesticated thousands of years ago. i think, along with sterilizing stray dogs, feeding them is the least we can do until our govt decides to spend significant resources to solve this issue. unpopular opinion : we should not have street dogs . [removed] please feed the dogs, they aren't bad and are most are very friendly. it's not their fault that the government didn't sterelize dogs in the begging, it's not their fault that they were born. they don't deserve to go in such a inhumane way. the world is theirs as much it is ours, coronavirus has taught us that.

throwawayap1022,2020-03-28,AskIndia,42,53,False,"should i forgive my sexual abuser? tw: sexual abuse/assault

hi reddit.

for context, i am 20f and my cousin is 28m now. i was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. i live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so i thought i would get the best opinion here. 

i've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). i would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. long story short, when i was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (i think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  i started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when i was sleeping). for those of you asking why i didn't stop him after the first time, i was scared of not being believed but i did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. anyway. recently i have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. i was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. i'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. our family is very close so i've been around him a lot these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and i *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. i want to forgive him, especially for myself, but i don't know how to do that. personally, i know that i need to have a conversation with him about this but i don't know how to bring this up. i don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but i think i'm prepared for both of those outcomes. my question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? i know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that i have forgiven him? also, how would you go about this situation? any and all advice is appreciated! thanks!",my cousin is a sexual abuser. do i confront him?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqdz4b/my_cousin_is_a_sexual_abuser_do_i_confront_him/," as a guy, with female cousins i can tell you your first cousin is an asshole, he definitely remembers what all he did and it doesn't matter if you've had great times after.. he is an abuser, put you in a vulnerable spot and exploited it because he probably figured you won't tell anyone.. i would make the younger ones in the family aware to stay away from him, upto your judgment to disclose anything, but make sure he doesn't do this to anyone 3else.. sorry for the long response but he sounds like a predator.. i would punch him in his balls if i knew who he was.. have a chat with him and let him know how you feel >my question is, is he worthy of forgiveness?

it all comes down to your mental health. if you think this'll help your mental health. go ahead and forgive him. 

>but does he deserve to know i have forgiven him?

you can forgive someone and still never see their face again or talk to them or let them have any authority on you. he did a shitty thing. forgiveness is more for you than it is for him. and honestly, seeing so many of these cases personally, he doesn't give a bloody rats ass if you forgive him or not. he probably will do it again if situation comes to it. hey, i hope you are doing okay and holding up well. writing a post and reading the comments can be triggering.  

child sexual abuse usually happens by people known to the child, as there is a certain level of trust that is enjoyed by the perpetrator which ensures silence from the child. i use the phrase child as i understand you were a minor at that time. the freezing part you wrote about is a body's response to a shocking situation that we may find ourselves. there were times when you were able to say stop, and i am sure it must not have been easy for you at all and requires a lot of courage. 

i see that you talk about confronting him and forgiving him in your post. i understand that it's important for you. and hence, more than speaking to the person, i feel you'd have to first find out what is it that you'd like to get from confronting him. what i mean to say is to first understand if the confrontation doesn't go as planned, what will happen to you then.  i see that you have identified two of such scenarios however there are various other possibilities too. best scenario being- him accepting and apologising and worst being- him blaming  and gaslighting you. that can also impact you a lot so that's there too. hence, it's important that you work through all these possibilities with a safe and trained person like a therapist and be prepared. 

moreover, the traumatic memories are certainly something that you'd want to forget, however the tricky part is that trauma lives and is remembered by our bodies too. and hence, i suggest what people here and in the original post have done, asked you to speak to a professional therapist, better if you can to someone who is trained in this particular area of work.   

>i'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult

i get what you are saying here. you have met this person in more than one context. and have spent a lot of time and have good memories with them too. i think i am just repeating you here but yeah, people are not all good or all bad.  people do a lot of deeds which can have impact on others which can be good or bad. however, what happened was not okay. please remember that. you can be their well-wisher and also feel a lot of hurt/ anger/hate towards them.  and also all these intense feelings can cause a state of complete confusion. it is complicated and hence i just want you to remember that whatever you feel is valid (till the time your feelings are not being manipulated by anyone else).  

also, in general and not related to forgiving someone who has abused you,  i personally believe that forgiveness is something that can be very personal. it may also not require confrontation but just a release of all the negativity that comes along with that person and event. it can be a process and not a one-off incident. it can also involve forgiving yourself for what happened and for not being able to protect oneself. 

i have a suggestion for you, it's a audio/podcast. it's called 'healing through letting go' by sarah blondin. i think it's 15-20 minutes long. i think you may resonate with it. 

take care, sending you peace and courage for whatever you decide to do. op you could try exposing him but indian parents mostly won't give a damn about it. if you keep seeing him every family get together, your health will go for a toss. i would move out in this type of situations if nothing goes right. 

 considering the current situation, you must observe him. if he is a changed man then you should forgive him.

 and if not you should tell it to a close family member( which is close to you) and i think they will help you better. [deleted] he is not a good person, let's get that clear first. he was 24 when he did this. it's a clear case of abuse and he's a pedo.

workoholiced,2020-04-14,AskIndia,15,26,False,"i have a dream of becoming a physician and work in my village/semi town because there is a lack of doctors and many people die before they reach their 60s. i can help them if i become a doctor and i don't mind working in rural area.

so do people like me attend med school in india. will i be able to post grad too if i want. how will be mylife in college?",do people at the age of 25 or above join mbbs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0zg5z/do_people_at_the_age_of_25_or_above_join_mbbs/," yes. i know of people who joined at 32. follow your dreams but lower your expectations overall. life will surprise you constantly in a good way. for that you have to attempt the entrance exam neet.

a couple of years ago, they had issues a rule stating that there was an upper age limit of 25 for unreserved candidates and 30 for candidates with reswevations.

however, that rule is challenged and until the supreme court passes a resolution, the upper limit is relaxed.

thus, neet guidelines, for now, is that there is no upper limit on age for attempts.

as for everything else?
once you get into mbbs, no one cares how old you are or what you do. you will still be ragged, it'll still be books before social life. hi, you will have to study and clear the neet. neet is very competetive. it has physics chem, zoology and botany.

and hopefully get a govt. seat which is affordable. private colleges charge a lot.
yeah i know of a few people who did b.e and then joined mbbs but they're filthy rich and their parents are self sufficient and continue to support these guys. (they send a monthly allowance). i know of even one guy in his 40s but he was in a well paying job in a foreign country then moved back with his savings and his family lives with him while he goes to college.

you will have to study for 4.5 years, and do 1 year of paid internship.

after that you can apply for your state govt. rural position and they will take you in if they have vacancies (which i'm sure they do, but i dont know if you'll get exactly where you want)

beware. it is a long and arduous path which will test the limits of your resolve. you need to remember a lot of things (although that is becoming easier with stuff like spaced repetition)

you seem like you don't care about the money. a service candidate practicing in rural areas is paid around 40,000 i believe. just sharing for your benefit.

i just want to give my 2 cents that it is sad your village people are dying, and it shows great heart in your intention to help them by becoming a doctor. however they are in this situation because of **systemic** problems that not even many good hearted individuals like you can fix. the only solution is to expand funding for healthcare as a portion of gdp, hopefully coronavirus will push in that direction. also first talk to your local mlas and mps to establish clinics and all. that helps a lot more than going through neet preparation and writing exams every 6 months in mbbs. some cities are actually sufficiently staffed with doctors, they don't want to practice in rural areas because they are compensated extremely poorly for the effort and time and sacrifice of youth that went into mbbs and md (8 years of studying, note that)

again, if you have a burning passion for medicine, go ahead. just know that this is the reality in front of you. the question is how desperate you are?", budbuk TheGoldenMagikarp129 ElDorado847 cherry0079,age 25 join mbbs dream becoming physician work village semi town lack doctors many die reach 60s help become doctor mind working rural area attend med school able post grad want mylife college

tablighs are just weird, man. it is a group of muslims which want to *bring back the old days* and want to practice islam the way it was when prophet muhammad (pbuh) existed.

the problem with that is - with changing times, religion too has to adjust likewise.

the core practices and the 5 pillars of islam will never change, but the way to approach it must.

just think about it - mecca and medina were closed off for outsiders but these people and their bahaduri!

a congregation of thousands with foreigners not properly screened for the virus and in turn culminating into a potential hotspot for the virus.

lockdown or not, the world is facing a pandemic since months now and you felt it was okay to jeopardise the health of your own fraternity and others who come in contact?

shame on them.

as a devout muslim, i will call them out. for their stupidity and recklessness.

also, that 100+ people from this jamaat have still not reported to testing centres in assam even though they have repeated asked for them to come. getting the virus is not a crime. lapses happen by us and our immune system. that can be forgiven. what can't be forgiven is hiding from the system and putting others at risk. it's reached as far as punjab in my tier 3 town with no cases before this whatsoever. the mayor of town himself confirmed this as the advisory was leaked on whatsapp along with details of 3 individuals from my area who attended. checkout faizan mustafa's excellent analysis on the matter. here's the link: https://youtu.be/ky9vdwoz7so this is a pretty good timeline.

RadRennie,2020-04-12,AskIndia,25,14,False,"namaskaram, redditors! 

i am an american woman (26), dating a south indian born man (32). even though we come from contrasting backgrounds, we share the same religious beliefs (we're both hindu), morals, and attitudes. recently, he told me that he loves me and wants to marry me, but there is one problem: his parents. 

his parents want to arrange a marriage for him. i'm not against this practice, but i happen to love this man, and i couldn't imagine a life without him (i know, very cliche). 

i understand that since i am not an indian woman (i'm  african-american and white), was raised muslim (i practice hinduism now), and that i am also the offspring of divorced and twice-married parents, that there is no way in hell my boyfriend's parents are going to approve of our marriage. 
my boyfriend is asking me to stay hopeful and travel to india with him this year so that his parents can meet me. during that time, he plans to ask his parents for their approval. 
i have been in two previous relationships where my ex-boyfriend's parents disapproved of me because i was black...and those relationships simply ended because they chose their parents over me. 

so, my question is, should i have faith in this relationship? even though my gut is telling me that i'll never see myself married to this man? or should i leave now before i'm disappointed and heartbroken in india?","should i stay hopeful, even though i feel his parents will disapprove of me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzu1pt/should_i_stay_hopeful_even_though_i_feel_his/," if he is asking you to join him in his trip home, isnt that a good sign he is willing to stand by you?

you both should start thinking about the way you will approach his parents.

there are some more details you need to consider.

1) is his family from a big city or small town or a village. big city based family might be more accepting.

2) south india has 5 distinct states. each state has different level of acceptance. 

3) have there already been any love marriages in his close family or his parent's friend group? usually the first love marriage in their social circle is very difficult to get accepted. 

all the best. ignore the parents and go to marriage registration office to register marriage. if he refuses, he is simply doing ""time pass"" with you. leave him.

he isn’t going to marry you.


this is a one of the most bullshit yet most effective breakup tactic here.

“i wouldn’t marry you if my parents don’t agree.” hi, of course try to convince his parents. it all depends on the level of education and background. south indians are open minded(well mostly) so no point giving up just now.   
wish you all the best 😀 you should definitely give it a shot. i'd say you guys shouldn't really bother about how the parents feel. however, if you really feel they should have a say in your affairs, you may give his parents a shot although it would not be the wisest thing to do. i am a south indian guy (31, catholic) and live with my girlfriend who is from east india and is a hindu. although my parents are more or less liberal and city-bred, but they weren't happy that i decided to live in with my partner. i didn't give my parents an option and decided to do what i wanted. although they came around eventually - but i wasn't too concerned about how they felt.

it is sometimes hard to convince indian parents about simple matters of love. the very fact that a generation of indian parents arrange marriages for their kids betrays how much store they place on brahminical patriarchal norms of marrying within their social groups, especially caste.

how does your partner feel about his parents? in case he skirts an open conversation about his parents and is not open to discussing how he feels about them and their views on marriage, it means they are conservative and would be a bit difficult changing their mindsets. marry him worry about his parents later. if the guy suddenly doesn't want to marry you because his parents say no then you must judge him for it and walk away so a little ,random , genuine and authentic question

Throwaway-messedup,2020-02-16,AskIndia,240,228,False,"i recently came across a ride-sharing app that enabled me to get a ride for less than 100, which would usually cost me around 250-300. it is environment friendly too. the app has been around for some time, but i just stumbled across it. it's called quickride, and no, i am in no way associated with it. 

it made me wonder about all the apps and businesses that don't get enough attention and support. 

what are some of the apps that you think people should know about? what does it do? does it solve a problem in society?

please don't recommend any dating apps.

**edit** 

*thanks everyone for sharing. here is the list of the apps mentioned in the thread; in case you can't go through all of the posts. i compiled them based on high votes and apps that i thought were useful for me as well.*


*sms organizer by microsoft - sorts smss out, filters out spam and promotional messages


*youtube vance, no ads, music still plays even if you screen lock


*splitwise. it helps to record all your expenses you did for your friends in your group or spliting bills within the group.


*daywise. it filters notifications and keeps the phone buzz-free. and a lot of apps have categorised their notifications which helps to prioritise which notifications to see.


*blokada app. best for blocking annoying ads on android apps. gives a premium add free app experience. 


*microsoft suite as an alternative for google suite


*solid explorer - file manager


*microsoft authenticator - 2fa, has cloud backup unlike google auth


*easy join - offline file transfer like share it


*oreotv: one of the best live streaming client & have movies too


*psiphon pro for vpn


*video transcoder - an opensource video spiliter or converter app which don't leave any watermark. available on f-droid


*lithium - opensource app for reading books in epub and its ad-free but there's pro paid version with sync and highlight


*bitwarden - password manager to autofill password by just remembering master password.


*tachiyomi - this is an opensource adfree app for manga that contains extensions of paid/ads manga apps.


*anyme x - to watch anime with no hassle and sync with mal.


*anybooks - for the love of reading


*telegram - a lot of people don't know but here you can get movies, series, courses and literally pc games by simply searching them.


*smart audio book player - this app is like audible but free which can play audiobooks according to chapters.


*mix file explorer- it support rar and also codecs of vlc to play any file.


*xodo - pdf reader with many features including syncing with pc software of xodo.


*shareme - adfree app to share files.


*kiwi browser or firefox - install addon/ extensions like nano adblocker and nano defender or ublock origin, keepa, sponserblock, adf ly killer, etc.


*smart tools - useful tools like ruler, compass


*brave browser: no ad in websites, no tracker. 


*newpipe for youtube.","[serious] what are some of the apps you love and recommend, but isn't mainstream?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f4jh0c/serious_what_are_some_of_the_apps_you_love_and/," sms organizer by microsoft - sorts smss out, filters out spam and promotional messages. it also has a neat finance tab where it shows a summary of transactions along with the balance. quite a handy app! youtube vance, no ads, music still plays even if you screen lock there is this app called splitwise. it helps to record all your expenses you did for your friends in your group or spliting bills within the group. 

it settles up all the expenses internally and simplifies bill spliting sms organizer, which someone mentioned already. 

and i swear by daywise. it filters notifications and keeps the phone buzz-free. and a lot of apps have categorised their notifications which helps to prioritise which notifications to see. so while you'll get uber ride alerts instantly, their promotional messages wont disturb you. blokada app. though not available on playstore, is one of the best for blocking annoying ads on android apps. gives a premium add free app experience.
everyone who see my apps on phone get amused when the see no ads or so on apps like merrium webster dictionary, wynk, etc.
 also i wanna mentioned vanced app for youtube.
mobilism for moded apps and games
and popcorn time for streaming movies from torrents. well, i won't really say these don't get enough attention. but many of these are definitely underrated. most of them are productivity-related. hopefully, it's not just a phase i'm going through.

ticktick as an alternative for todoist. 

that one app is my todo list, calendar, & habit tracker. the widgets are customizable & pretty., syncs with gcal and if you decide to pay, it's 1/3 the price of todoist. the only thing todoist is better at is amazing gcal sync. and you can implement super simple to pretty complex productivity systems on it.

microsoft suite as an alternative for google suite (except search)

onedrive as an alt for google drive. it's cheaper and less of a hassle than google drive because it looks exactly like normal folders online and you get office 365 free. everyone's talking sms organizer here. microsoft launcher(beta) with onedrive syncs everything you do with your laptop to your phone. the todo and notes app syncs to the side panel too. officelens > camscanner.

yt vanced > youtube&spotify. (if it doesn't work for you, just ask someone on their discord)

ankidroid if you're in uni or school. way better than writing notes and cramming the last moment.

notion as an alt for evernote/onenote/trello etc. (though that's debatable if you're on android, also there's a learning curve). 

google camera import for whatever device you own from xda > default camera app.(most probably) 

and if you're daring enough,  
stickk or beeminder. (bet money on succeding on something you wanna do. lose that money if you fuck up) smart kit by kafui tools on the play store. it's a collection of small useful apps built into one. walnut.. tracks expenses and bill reminders only from sms. sd maid pro - only cleaning app you need   
solid explorer - file manager   
microsoft authenticator - 2fa, has cloud backup unlike google auth  
easy join - offline file transfer like share it simple habit for meditation. it has a very generous free tier compared to other meditation apps.   
crono for syncing notifications and sending links between your mobile and desktop chrome browsers. very useful when you don't want to keep checking your mobile, especially at work. it also supports direct replies to whatsapp messages and instagram dms from the crono desktop widget. if you use a linux based os, kdeconnect is good app for syncing between your pc and android phone. when in the same network it does things like - play/pause music/movies when a call comes, get message notifications on pc - you can also reply to messages, share clipboard, play/pause media, run scripts and a lot more.", zakiiboy kupKACHES _alphabetagamma_ irctcpantrycar Ded-Futiya kantaBane AdwinVandal sh1211 EveryoneIsABotxceptU tejaskinger23 aphnx,serious apps love recommend mainstream recently came across ride sharing app enabled ride less 100 would usually cost around 250 300 environment friendly too app around stumbled across called quickride no way associated made wonder apps businesses enough attention support apps think know about do solve problem society please recommend dating apps edit thanks everyone sharing list apps mentioned thread case can t go posts compiled based high votes apps thought useful well sms organizer microsoft sorts smss out filters spam promotional messages youtube vance ads music still plays screen lock splitwise helps record expenses friends group spliting bills within group daywise filters notifications keeps phone buzz free lot apps categorised notifications helps prioritise notifications see blokada app best blocking annoying ads android apps gives premium add free app experience microsoft suite alternative google suite solid explorer file manager microsoft authenticator 2fa cloud backup unlike google auth easy join offline file transfer share oreotv best live streaming client movies psiphon pro vpn video transcoder opensource video spiliter converter app leave watermark available f droid lithium opensource app reading books epub ad free there pro paid version sync highlight bitwarden password manager autofill password remembering master password tachiyomi opensource adfree app manga contains extensions paid ads manga apps anyme x watch anime hassle sync mal anybooks love reading telegram lot know movies series courses literally pc games simply searching them smart audio book player app audible free play audiobooks according chapters mix file explorer support rar codecs vlc play file xodo pdf reader many features including syncing pc software xodo shareme adfree app share files kiwi browser firefox install addon extensions nano adblocker nano defender ublock origin keepa sponserblock adf ly killer etc smart tools useful tools ruler compass brave browser ad websites tracker newpipe youtube

the best way to know is to enquire with the locals and nearby friends. ok do this. ask some friend who is near to office (say around 2km or so) to pickup your stuff and then you go and pickup from him. 
or second option is use all internal roads and by lanes only to reach to your office and way back. do venture on a main road and do this early in morning like 4-5 am.

hopefully you will not encounter police and if you do please be polite and try to make them understand. no.

ashleyggrande,2020-03-16,AskIndia,73,50,False,"wassup my fellow desi people, 

i want to move to india but i don’t know how to speak hindi or any other language there; but i do know english. once i graduate in hr management and spanish, do you think i can make a living over there? do i need to learn hindi? can a foreigner who only speaks english work in a business environment? are demand for spanish teachers? thanks !!!","moving to india in future, am i qualified?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjdo0i/moving_to_india_in_future_am_i_qualified/," there are lots of foreigners who come to india for work on a semi-permanent basis. according to indian laws, foreigners must be paid at least 24 lakhs (2.4 million inr) per year to be eligible for work visas. i am not sure about the spanish teaching scene, but a quick look on [naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/spanish-teacher-jobs-in-india) shows they don't pay so much. so perhaps these institutes hire local spanish teachers. 

why don't you try jobs at the spanish embassy/consulates in india? they probably have a good demand for spaniards who can speak english. 1.there are loads of opportunities for expats!
2. in terms of spanish language teacher, there are opportunities in major metros. there is also opportunities for teaching spanish cusine and dance. 
3. in terms of hr in management, corporate culture varies in india which sometimes frustrates a lot of expats but there are many who thrive here also. it depends on the company and its work culture and where you fit in it.
4. my big concern if any to tell you is safety. women's security in india is not horrible but sketchy. it would be safe to intially travel with friends especially after dusk, and understand some safety measures and precautions first hand. yes, absolutely, you can make a living over here and pretty much have a good life, more chaotic though.

you will catch the basic conversations in local languages over a period of time as you move around doing regular chores, which should be enough. learning hindi isn't essential.

english would be more than enough in a business environment. 

demand for spanish teachers is something i can't contribute to, hyderabad has a foreign language university, which has spanish as the 3rd most learnt language.

you are pretty well qualified to live a comfortable life here. all the best :) hey,

yes you definately can. and i particularly know an institute that is looking specifically for native spanish speakers.

they are willing to pay a good salary too.

go to the website of this organisation called aiesec. 

it's a non-profit that works to help students and young people get international internships and volunteering experiences.

you could look at the opportunities there and see which ones  you are interested in.

additional you can also message me if you wish to come down for the opportunity i mentioned above, which is in the city of chennai. > do you think i can make a living overthere? do i need to learn hindi?

there is lot of linguistic diversity in india. if you are going to delhi or mumbai, then it would definitely be easier if you learn hindi. atleast the conversational hindi. 

> can a foreigner who only speaks english work in a business environment?

yes. your work life should not be too much of an issue without the knowledge of indian languages. it's the simple things like taking a cab, buying groceries, etc. which require you to learn the local language.

> are demand for spanish teachers?

not that much. or atleast i am not aware of. among the foreign languages, there is more demand for french, german and mandarin as far as i know. first, promise me some home made tacos. yes, you can come here. there is a learning curve to living in india, a huge one infact. but if you live in the major cities, you wouldn't face a lot of issues atleast not languages based. you can pickup hindi or whatever local language prevalent in the region soon enough. 
yes, there have been issues with women safety and security in india as of late, but can you or anyone guarantee that females won't face harassment or any similar issues in developed countries?
and regarding jobs, you can get them in major cities without a lot of hassle. by the way, you should come to india and live here for a year or two and then decide what you feel about this culturally vibrant country of ours, how about that, eh? hey. india has so many lanuages that even learning hindi won't help you many states. so i'd say english is good enough to start. most cities have a good number of english people and can help you with interactions with the non-english speaking locals. you'll pick bits and pieces eventually.  


hr management has a good number of jobs with a lot of them being english speaking ones. so again, language or job prospects shouldn't be a problem. i am no expert on spanish related jobs but i still feel that you can get a job as interpreter or a teacher at a lot of places. ( few french teach here work at an institute called alliance francaise and may be there's something similar for spanish).  


apart from that, a few major cities are relatively unsafe for women. also jobs wouldn't be as paying and even the work at times is not that amazing unless you find a right job. apart from that, make sure you learn a few techniques of what we like to call ""jugaad"" (basically life-hacks like bargaining, mode of travelling etc). yes you can definitely work. indians worship foreigners but why you want to come is the question. nothing is up here. don't come. there's 13+ major languages here, depending on the stage you go to.", Froogler bluelappy84 None BaBaBlackshepp Fabulous-Rice AkashGvpta Masked96 DesiPattha psy_think up_for_adoption hurricane_news,moving future qualified wassup fellow desi want move don t know speak hindi language there know english graduate hr management spanish think make living there need learn hindi foreigner speaks english work business environment demand spanish teachers thanks

one can do anything they want to others, without fear of law, and jaggi allows them to do it under his ashram. ofcourse why he preaches is pretty much common to find in books. i work in an indian company which is more than 100 yrs old and fortune 500. (very few of them exist). 

one of our past mds from 80s and 90s period, who is considered to be the organization's modern architect and who is revered by people for his attitude, scientific approach and wisdom, he is one of the foremost patrons of sadguru. i can't wrap my head around it. he is being shown as a marketing tool as well to attract more industry personalities. i used to adore this guy since i have joined here because i have seen his work and heard him speak. 

sadguru sure has some sacred games level dope shit going around somewhere in his shrines. there is no other way this can be explained. u know just the same as some of the smart and educated people supported and bought into the development and growth model shit a few years ago (some still do)...more than anything else, i believe that people really fall for people who can talk smart even if it is just rhetorical and has no sense in it, commonly known as '***framing cognitive bias'***...the fact that they are hearing it for the first time makes it all the more enticing..and smartness alone is not sufficient, you need time to think through and comprehend something...and most people do not want to spend their intellect on thinking about something that is accepted by like minded people which alludes to '***confirmation bias'..*** just like how people with masters and ability for independent thought buy into modi’s propaganda.

and what if this lady cites her own example and forces people to work under her when actually they need to be somewhere else?

no way i'm going to consider her as a model bureaucrat. she's like that kid in the school and college who will do whatever it takes to finish homework, come to the class even in floods and unnecessarily be the star-kid in the eyes of the teacher. i so don't want this culture to be promoted. not a good news, ias officers come in daily contact with many people. i would worry about **three** people handling a baby daily in current circumstances. doesn't india have laws regarding paid maternity leave? why would you come to your job with your child, especially in such times?

i'm sorry, but i find nothing praiseworthy here. nice pr she still let photographers into her office to click this photo when it was not absolutely necessary , so how well is she protecting her baby again ? with the daily rise in covid cases which everyone knows can be deadly for infants and oldage... she's bringing her child to prove what? she's the only hardworking mother in this world? and what dafaq ppl congratulating her for? i am glad to find a lot of comments here calling her out. even removing the dangerous situation she is putting her child in the current state of affairs, this is nothing praiseworthy or exemplary. women who have delivered baby/had csection needs proper rest and recovery period. that's why maternity leave exists. i had to go back to work at 12 weeks leaving my newborn to a care taker. i had to pump 3 times at office and still be productive as my male colleagues. after coming from office, i don't have time to rest because i need to relieve the care taker and let her rest. i couldn't sleep well, because baby needs to be fed every few hours through night as well. then there is the overhead of cleaning and sterilizing bottles and pump parts. delivery is traumatic. csection is a major surgery. women should be allowed to recover and dedicate their time to their babies before joining back to workforce. they will be more productive that way. glorifying toxic work culture is more damaging than anything. i feel this is just a publicity gimmick!

why is that so many ias officers who are doing some incredible work (especially related to tribal people) are not publicised? why are they not seen in trending news or searches? wait, i thought maternity leave is compulsory. a female can waive the leave? while i'm impressed with her dedication, i agree with every other commenter. she is jeopardising the child's life by coming in to work in this scenario. 

plus, maybe i'm jaded but this feels more like a publicity stunt than anything else. feel free to correct me. i'm a pessimistic person by nature and i feel like this is just a show to prove how ""work trumps all"" is her motto or whatever.

but on a cheerier note, congratulations on the baby. i wish him a healthy wonderful life. any reason why her husband cannot take care of the child? it's not a good environment for the baby.", Iwaspepsodent_99 WANDERLS7 Imaginary_Pumpkin sinha7adarsh xXtigressXx instinctGauTaM donttalkaboutpoland thelilpainterfellow jinnemeradilluteya ThatRedScooter jrhuman,ias officer srijana gummalla returned work 22 days giving birth son

on 13th december 1971, us president nixon redirected the 7th navy fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier uss enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the bay of bengal to stop india from liberating bangladesh

indian prime minister indira gandhi promptly called on moscow to invoke a secret provision in the india-soviety treaty under which russia was bound to defend india in case of any external aggression. russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a nuclear submarine from vladivostok on 13th december, 1971 under the command of admiral vladimir kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the us fleet to advance and attack the military bases of india. 

the only thing standing between the us fleet and the indian cities was the indian aircraft carrier ins vikrant and the russian fleet, so india and russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

as the us aircraft carrier was entering the bay of bengal to attack india, for the first time in human history the russians decided to intentionally bring their nuclear submarine to the surface and let the americans see them.

as soon as the russian submarine surfaced on the bay of bengal, the us admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'we are too late, the russians are already here'
the mere fact of seeing russian nuclear warheads in the bay of bengal changed america's mind and they retreated.

russia further went on to say 'a war on india will be considered a war on russia' and threatened china to not join the conflict on orders of the us and threatened to sink sinkiang (a region in china) if they tried to stop india from liberating bangladesh.

ever since then india has considered russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of russian weapons and nuclear reactors in the world.

that's the reason a russian president has never set foot in pakistan.","(story time) 13th dec, 1971 - the day when russian nuclear warheads surfaced on the bay of bengal to stop uss enterprise from attacking india",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz62ox/story_time_13th_dec_1971_the_day_when_russian/," please explain why usa likes to poke its nose in every conflict? (especially this one) if anyone wants to read about the events leading up to this, check out blood telegram by the us ambassador in dhaka at that point of time. in this war, after the fall of dhaka, approx 90k pakistani soldiers surrendered to the indian army. it is one of the largest surrender in war. lmao, i thought uss enterprise was from star trek in the title i always wonder what exactly happened so that russia started backing china more than india. 

not entirely modi's fault because that started happening before 2002... didn't know this, me likey! thanks for sharing :) all criticism the media has made about her aside indira gandhi was a really strong woman who literally took no shit from anyone, a fearless woman of action. the first thought that came to my mind was how much political mileage our beloved man-who-should-not-be-named-because-i-am-not-using-vpn would have gained out of such a strategic victory over an opposition as mighty as the united states. there would have been movies about it within less than an year, of course, and media channels would be shouting out their lungs on repeat for several years at the very least, and votes would be sought and gained on this for at least the next 3-4 general elections.  


wonder how this played out in the indian populace at the time of indira. given i had not heard this before today and i consider myself to be a decently informed citizen, at least by the average standards. and why is any of this not brought up when talking about the 65-70 years of congress in which nothing was ever done except ruining the sone ki chidiya that india was when the british left us in '47. fun fact: sinkiang is today known as xinjiang (or perhaps east turkestan) and is home to the uighur muslims, china's ethnic muslims who have been (by some accounts) mistreated by the chinese authorities. this is a piece of history i knew nothing about..wow.. we need more of these in there!", 21022018 m4ycd11 morghulis- thundermage117 ProfessorFreeza ok2fail Ilovebootycakes26 thelogicaljaat TantalizingTart HelaArt uddhav_15,story 13th dec 1971 day russian nuclear warheads surfaced bay bengal stop uss enterprise attacking 1971 war pakistan liberation bangladesh formerly known east pakistan us uk sided pakistan sent warships us 13th december 1971 us president nixon redirected 7th navy fleet led 75 000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier uss enterprise powerful warship world go bay bengal stop liberating bangladesh prime minister indira gandhi promptly called moscow invoke secret provision soviety treaty russia bound defend case external aggression russia sent nuclear armed flotilla including nuclear submarine vladivostok 13th december 1971 command admiral vladimir kuroyedov orders allow us fleet advance attack military bases thing standing us fleet cities aircraft carrier ins vikrant russian fleet russia came crafty plan stop them us aircraft carrier entering bay bengal attack first human history russians decided intentionally bring nuclear submarine surface let americans see them soon russian submarine surfaced bay bengal us admiral lost hope made following quote we late russians already here mere fact seeing russian nuclear warheads bay bengal changed america mind retreated russia went say a war considered war russia threatened china join conflict orders us threatened sink sinkiang a region china tried stop liberating bangladesh ever since considered russia trusted ally world largest importer russian weapons nuclear reactors world that reason russian president never set foot pakistan

what are these? it's so disturbing. i'm seeing ptc news right now. and some guy is denying that these people were not the real thing. now this will turn to politics. a poor policeman lost his arm and these people are discussing fucking politics. as someone living in punjab, let me share some insights about nihangs :

\- they are very few in number. my town of 1.5 lakh population probably has only 10-20 nihangs living here. there is only one street in my town, where these people supposedly live. i have never met even a single nihang in last 10-15 years

\- they are remnants of orthodox sikhism. no normal person would aspire to be part of them. in earlier sikhism, they were one sect of traditional sikh warriors.

\- i guess modern day nihangs are religious zealots/idiots who can't fit into any other job or they were born into these sects. or they maybe extremely poor people or orphans, who might be recruited by sects/deras

\- they live in groups/deras and some of them live a nomadic life

\- they defraud people (village people) ...collect money from them and mostly spend money on their drugs and gaining more power for their idiotic sects.

\- i will stress this again  : - they are nothing but drug addicts as of now.

\- they don't have any spiritual or moral standing among people of punjab. although government won't ban them or ask them not to carry weapons, but if it does, normal people won't even bat an eyelid. it is a fringe sect that is obsolete here is the video of the incident - https://twitter.com/adityarajkaul/status/1249205642239397889 [nsfw] so when ucc is passed. will these guys be stopped from wielding weapons? these people are a disgrace to sikh community. i feel so sad for asi. he just doing his duty just to protect people. that attacker was stupid. he deserve strict punishment. none of the news channels are discussing it. there are no debates on the mentality of the sikh community. 

no, this incident does not reflects on the sikh community. but neither do any of the incident reflects on the muslim community. but our media loves to perpetuates stereotypes. sikhs are humanity-lovers, muslims a burden on the mother earth. any news which challenges these stereotypes will be neglected and ignored, without even a hint of embarassment.", punjabi_pikachu witchy_cheetah xillionare Z3DLooP shady797 msinghmsn india_ko_vanakkam JagdishBhagat12khadi fried_maggi iluvredditalot trickletan,cop hand chopped off two others injured attack nihangs punjab patiala

voters rewarded modi's rash decision of demonetization, which made life miserable for honest citizens, and didn't do squat about 'cleaning up black money',   with a thumping victory in the up elections. if the bjp had been beaten badly in *that* election, modi would have been much more cautious afterwards.

if you reward politicians (any politician, not just modi) of any party, (not just the bjp) for making dumb decisions, you have to expect they'll repeat their actions. politicians respond to reward and punishment just like other professions do. i haven't been totally supportive of the government's response so far, my primary complaint being the lack of testing. however, with the sheer number of migrant workers, i wonder what solutions were feasible? any arrangement of mass transportation, like train/bus services would risk infecting millions. it just seems like the administration was stuck between a rock and a hard place. you get,""main gareeb hoon bhaiyon aur behnon,main is desh k gareeb k liye kaam karunga. main is desh ko bikne ni dunga"" sales pitch and you buy that,specially when you have enough numbers to swing the elections. the only problem is most of those flown in are migrant workers and students from other countries not rich people. most of them di not have white collar jobs abroad.

and even if they were, if they are indian citizens and potentially can face persecution in a foreign nation if they do not have a visa. 

would anyone have preferred leaving our own citizens stateless?

while i do not agree with the government's heavy-handedness in dealing with protests which erupted earlier this year, flying in citizens from foreign nations was the right thing to do. ""what do we get""

""excercise"" nothing, people will remain poor no matter what you do, if you increase the minimum wage even to 500 per hr, there will be poor people, if you remove all the rich people no one will have the incentive to get rich and everyone just becomes poor, this is why there are social measures like bpl card and progressive income tax.  
in the time of a disaster like this, if they are denied from getting basic necessities they should demand the govt to fix this instead of giving the vote to the guy who pays 500bucks. that’s the way the capitalistic world in the time of technological revolution is gonna be. capitalism, by definition rewards those with entrepreneurial zeal and/or capital. any of the two is enough to live a decent life in today’s world, theoretically. but our public system has pushed marginalised people so far back that they do not even believe that they can do better, they just accept the situation as is. that is the reason for there backwardness, lack of belief and lack of good governance.

various ideas like universal basic income/services are being touted as the solution to the ever increasing inequality and lack of social mobility, and the increasing joblessness due to technological innovations. whatever the case, it’s for governments to decide whether all humans are equal, and arguments from both sides carry weight.

currently, it’s widely agreed that all humans are equal and therefore governments must take necessary steps so as to ensure equality in terms of opportunities, services and everything else. in the meantime, bhakts are blaming kejriwal solely for this covid-19 subreddits. modiji tried his best, apparently. food subsidies sad, but not that sad. looks fine to me, given the situation. 

last week, my brother couldn't buy insulin and couldn't find his doctor to administer the shot. he went out in car to whatever random hospital he can find closest. a year ago, he was 20 days intubated in icu. and if he catches this virus or any other, his body is likely to struggle against it. 

not everyone walks long distances and is in front of a camera, because their suffering is irrelevant to any political agenda. doesn't make suffering any less real. i am not privileged. everyone has suffering, you will only hear about the ones that further some political ideology. so...i can't stand this ""rich get this, poor get nothing.""

this crisis will make everything shittier and will bring up what has always been the reality and not necessarily only in india.

please, i request everyone to see it in the right context. that context is this pandemic the whole world is facing. it's a ""crisis"" for a reason.

i'm a muslim residing outside of india, i spoke to my parents today and it broke my heart. 

while everyone took part in whatever happened at 9 pm yesterday, my family took part in it entirely out of fear. fear of being singled out if any of the lights in our house were switched on even by mistake. my mom switched off all the lights 5 minutes before 9 pm and double checked it, if she hadn't left anything on even by mistake. call this paranoia or whatever, my family doesn't deserve this.

and, we live in one of the most safest neighborhoods in mumbai.

so kudos! the islamaphobia has paid off, my family feels unsafe in its own home :)","kudos to everyone, for making my family feel very safe in these times!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvsbrp/kudos_to_everyone_for_making_my_family_feel_very/," well my parents are hindus and even they switched off the lights out of fear of bhakt neighbours as well. but yeah i understand , this islamaphobia is only going to get worse the longer bjp stays in power. yeah we're muslims too and had to switch off all the lights because our colony went dark and people came out with diyas and started staring at our house. this is not just muslims. anyone who doesn't abide by what pm modi has said is looked down by his followers. 

it's the same when a radicalized muslim look down upon a free and liberal muslim. for example, my friend who goes to jamaat look down upon all of us for not following religious instructions. he doesn't play holi and argues with those muslims who plays saying it's against islam and why don't they adhere to preachings by their religious leaders. it has been everywhere in our society. every section of our society suffers from it. 

and lighting diyas is nothing but an act of symbolism, that's it. and people who believe that this will cure virus are fools, and my request is stop worrying about them. these are the times to stand together. 500 cases/day now. and we don't know how many more are not tested yet. bro i am a muslim we live in a small town bhuj. 
the rss goons came out and chanted jaishree ram in front of our house we didn't turned of lights. 
they tried to threaten us but they didn't knew our whole family  lives in one compound  they backed off when my brothers and uncles got out of the house.

ps we were 12 and they were 5 or 6. 
it was never like this in our town man times were much simpler and peaceful. but now people are turning in to uncivilised goons. welcome to new india (ramrajya)... we can tear away the constitution and throw it in ganges. kingdom ruling will be back soon in india. ravish kumar is so right. modi has only brought out anti muslim policies this whole time. as a muslim i completely second that, we also turned the lights off due to plain fear. people even yelled bharat mata ki jai and pakistan muradabad in my colony, now this is something next level. even some hindu families did it out of fear. i can a get a sense of how you are feeling.

well, my elder brother who is a rationalist perhaps from the moment he was born, led our house to switch on all the lights, all the appliances. the only house in our locality acting as a lighthouse in the sea of darkness. and ohh, we are hindu btw. 😄

and then he went on to donate directly to our district labour commissioner's appeal for donations to help feed hundreds of migrant labourers who are stuck with nothing in our state.

this is going to have long term effects. amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes i am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women. once this corona virus fiasco is over, no one will pay attention to how government failed it's duty towards daily wage workers, health workers but this incident will be highlighted and it will be used for political gains. life of ordinary muslims in india who had nothing to do with tabliki jamat will get screwed.",[hear me out] tabliki jamat incident has screwed ordinary indian muslim's life for coming years,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fva7ot/hear_me_out_tabliki_jamat_incident_has_screwed/," [removed] one of friend when he called me told that india has fought the virus very well till know and except muslims everyone is doing their patriotic duty by staying home ..

my father when he called, me told that muslims are spreading the virus intentionally because they believe it is sent by allah to kill evil forces, so they want to spread it everywhere according to their god's wish..

test result came negative. what i see in social media is that the anger against the virus is getting channeled towards muslims for the delhi incident, kejriwal for failing to prevent the delhi incident, kerala led by communist government for being the state with high number of initial cases imported from communist china and islamic middle east and then spreading it all over india.. and ofcourse the usual suspects like mamta, rahul gandhi, ravish kumar etc for criticising modi and doing politics during such a time of war like crisis.. [removed] as a hindu, the most i can say is - the liberal left of indian society will fight on for your rights. how the first cases of the virus in india happen in the first place? i'm a muslim stuck in goa, i mean every part of india is blaming like ,"" ye mullo ne case badha dia "" , ,"" ye nizamuddin mai joh muslims haina unki wajhe se cases aaj itne zyada hogaye "".

i know it's not alright to organise this big event at this time but i'm 100% sure that at 10-15 march whole india were sleeping on this, it's the responsibility of government that why they let this big event get organised at that time. 

but, it's like a dream for bjp to find people at nizamuddin. they get people to put their blame on and cherry on top is that they're muslim. so they'll do whatever possible to frame it like we tried but see muslims are bad so because of them it happens. 

it's a nice virus, if this government doesn't do some good measures other than banging utensils and lighting dia and candles then i'm afraid what our future is going to be and i'm 100% sure that people will blame it all on tablighi jamaat like it's there intention to spread the virus in india.

i thought that time that he's just taking the hype nothing much but now as i saw it, this government never leave a chance to defame the muslims of this country, not even a single chance, they're create chances and find ways to defame a particular community of this country. maybe i'm sounding too much but in past 3-4 days every other guy i talked to about corona brings tablighi jamaat as the main reason for it, no sense in their talking, they don't know what the desiese is from where it spread and came. it's like after sometime in india people will start to blame muslims for codvid 19 not china.", None BeefJumlaPakistan None 21022018 knowsalotofthings cold-flame AAPkeMoohMe None fatherofgodfather Drifter_01 why2chose,hear out tabliki jamat incident screwed ordinary muslim life coming years last week everyone news channels focused battling corona virus then tabliki jamat incident came entire narrative shifted everyone corona virus indians muslims spreading corona virus videos some true others not started circulating blaming muslims spread corona virus terms corona jihad coined news channels running shows day night tabliki jamat members spread virus remotest places actions muslim incident indore tiktok video guy malegaon gave fire going long term effects amount hate circulated whatsapp groups news channels twitter forums going last longer corona virus fiasco many able remain tolerant yes using word liberal tolerant muslim business relations talking cutting ties them already news coming attacks masjid doctors refusing treat muslim women corona virus fiasco over pay attention failed duty towards daily wage workers health workers incident highlighted used political gains life ordinary muslims nothing tabliki jamat screwed

field marshal sam manekshaw who was passing by and asked the youngster as to what was happening. the youngster said, “sir, this soldier had the audacity of not saluting me. so i have punished him with 1000 salutes.”
sam replied, “bloody good punishment young man, but ensure that you return each of his salutes.”

the **jallianwala bagh massacre**, also known as the **amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 april 1919, when acting brigadier-general reginald dyer ordered troops of the british indian army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed indian civilians in jallianwala bagh, amritsar, punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. over 1,000 people were injured.

some facts about the jallianwala bagh massacre:

1. the precursor to the massacre was the rowlatt act. this act was passed in february 1919.
2. the rowlatt act gave the british government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. the rowlatt act was basically designed for controlling activities of indian revolutionaries.
4. protesting against the act, the indians observed a hartal on march 30th and april 6th of 1919.
5. on april 10, 1919, two famous leaders, dr. kitchlew and dr. satyapal were arrested on the basis of the rowlatt act.
6. two days later on the 12th of april, 1919, general dyer took command of troops. he issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. the gathering had no political intent at all. it was meant for celebrating baisakhi – the sikh festival.
9. anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh on the evening of that day.
10. the gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating baisakhi.
11. though the festival was a sikh festival, many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same. all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh.
12. apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. this is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. apart from gurkha and  baluchi soldiers using scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. according to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before colonel dyer ordered the firing.
15. the firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. the shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent british actions spread throughout the subcontinent. the bengali poet and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the indian nationalist struggle.
19. dyer was initially lauded for his actions in britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [british raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_raj) such as members of the [house of lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords). he was, however, widely criticised in the [house of commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_commons), whose july 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. the government of india ordered an investigation of the incident (the hunter commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. the last known survivor of the jallianwala bagh massacre, shingara singh, died in amritsar on june 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. the british government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in india and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in britain until december 1919.
23. this event caused many moderate indians to abandon their loyalty to the  british and become nationalists distrustful of the british
24. colonel dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which major general william beynon replied:  ""your action correct and lieutenant governor approves
25. both [secretary of state for war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state_for_war) [winston churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winston_churchill) and former prime minister [h. h. asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h._h._asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. winston churchill, in the house of commons debate of 8 july 1920, said,  ""the crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. it was not attacking anybody or anything… when the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than trafalgar square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. when the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. the fire was then directed to the sides.  many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. this was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. after churchill's speech in the house of commons debate, mps voted 247 to 37 against dyer and in support of the government.
28. the general dyer-led massacre at amritsar’s jalianwalla bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of indians.
29. colonel michael o'dwyer was shot dead on 13 march, 1940, by a man named udham singh, a member of the revolutionist ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  jallianwala bagh massacre.
30. the casualty number estimated by the indian national congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. indian nationalist [swami shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swami_shraddhanand) wrote to gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# shaheed uddham singh

1. **shaheed udham singh** (26 december 1899 – 31 july 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the ghadar party best known for his  assassination in london of michael o'dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of punjab in india, on 13 march 1940
2.  while in custody, he used the name **ram mohammad singh azad**, which represents the three major religions of punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. shaheed uddham singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of punjab province, general  michael o'dyer.
4. while awaiting his trial, singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. on 4 june 1940
5. when asked about his motivation, singh explained:

>i did it because i had a grudge against him. he deserved  it. he was the real culprit. he wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so i have crushed him. for full 21 years, i have been trying to  seek vengeance. i am happy that i have done the job. i am not scared of  death. i am dying for my country.  i have seen my people starving in  india under the british rule. i have protested against this, it was my  duty. what greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. on 31 july 1940, singh was hanged at [pentonville prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentonville_prison).

# following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] however, political activists who had set up the shaheed udham singh trust and working with the indian workers association (gb), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

he started the speech with a denunciation of british imperialism:

>""i say down with british imperialism. you say india do not have peace. we have only slavery generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  all you have to do is read your own history. if you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. the brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>at this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""i do not care about the sentence of death. it means nothing at all.  i do not care about dying or anything. i do not worry about it at all. i  am dying for a purpose.’ thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘we are suffering from the british empire.’ udham singh continued more quietly. ‘i am not afraid to die. i am proud to die, to have to free my native land and i hope that when i am gone, i hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""i am standing before an english jury. i am in an english court.  you people go to india and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the house of commons. we come to england and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""i never meant anything, but i will take it. i do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to india there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of india. all your british imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""machine guns on the streets of india mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  christianity flies.’  
>  
>""your conduct, your conduct – i am talking about the british government. i have nothing against the english people at all. i have more english friends living in england than i have in india. i have great sympathy with the workers of england. i am against the imperialist  government.’  
>  
>""you people are suffering – workers. everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. india is only slavery.  killing, mutilating and destroying – british imperialism. people do not read about it in the papers. we know what is going on in india.""  
>  
>at this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but singh continued:  
>  
>""you ask me what i have to say. i am saying it. because you people are dirty. you do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  india.  
>  
>he then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'down with british imperialism! down with british dirty dogs!""  
>  
>he turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200b;

his remains are preserved at the jallianwala bagh in amritsar, punjab.  on every 31 july, marches are held in sunam by various organizations and every statue of singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

given the quality and frequency of your posts, i presumed you were one of the mods. til the gathering had no political intent. i always thought there was an element of protest too, against the detention of saifuddin kitchlew and lala lajpat rai (i think). random fact. general reginal dyer's father edward abraham dyer set up a brewery in kasauli, himachal pradesh to cater to the british requirement for cheap beer. this brewery changed hands and became a distillery by the name of mohan meakin pvt. ltd. which is popularly known as **old monk** thanks for the info!     29. colonel reginald dyer was shot dead on 13 march, 1940, by a man named udham singh

i believe you've mistakenly mixed michael o'dwyer name with colonel reginald dyer. lovely. please make a compilation of the anti sikh riots of 1984 as well if possible.. wow the movies only say about the dyer running back to uk and never returning back to india.  
i did not know that he was assassinated until i read your post. thanks for telling me something new. have an upvote op! :) almost 80 years after shaheed udham singh was executed, we still swim nose deep in imperialism and millions of children die every year because of imperialist exploitation.

they say, ""there are no guns anymore"", but that only means death is slower and more painful.  nice read more about it and the general surrounding conditions and the apparent british thinking behind it read jallianwala bagh: an empire of fear and the making of the amritsar massacre. `though the festival was a sikh festival, many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same. all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh.`

afaik, whatsapp chats are based on e2e encryption due to which no one else can see our messages not even whatsapp employees. so, how are they arresting people? whatsapp is garbage messenger, important people don't use this app.  everybody keep whatsapp because everybody is on whatsapp, working people who require frequent messaging don't use it due to group mess.

whats app seriously need to provide following features before working people start using it.

1. separate tabs for groups. people receive thousands of messages from groups and often important one to one messages are missed due to this. many people often do not respond or response very late because this miss one to one chat's due to large number group messages.
2. admin ability to control messages in group. admin ability to delete any messages in group.
3. mute people in group. often time particular aunties / uncles / few people keep spamming in groups.  its very annoying reading same kind of messages from these people. we have aunty who keep forwarding political messages, one who keep posting environment messages, one who keep forwarding devotional messages and hence important messages are lost.  if we can just mute these people in groups, it will be amazing and will saves years of time for every one.
4. some focking display profile privacy, not everybody wants to show their profile picture to delivery boys, vegetable vendors and god knows who is in the contact list.  whatsapp display profile have no privacy features.

kennyomega296,2020-03-16,Non-Political,124,1991,False,,"no safety gear, no protection for construction workers. that's how building homes works in our country",https://i.redd.it/mq3gokk3w0n41.jpg," i worked in a small construction company and everyday i will ask them to wear safety belt while hanging and drilling/painting outside the walls 3 storeys high. they won't listen, i told them 'no safety no work and you should quit', motherfuckers complained to the owner of my company and that fucking idiot gave me an earful, he said 'what just because you are an engineer you are in some pedestal or something? this how india is, don't think you are cool just becuse you have degree'. idiot owner gets offended for asking people to adhere to safety.the guy drives a audi and he dosent give a shit about their safety. gives abysmal wage, don't think it's the minimum wage.but those poor construction guys just work, no shoes, safety belts, hard hats nothing. 

they think having safety gear is not cool or hip. i even told i would buy with my own salary but these guys didn't care.

 but not everywhere it's like this, like the other comment said, big construction area's will require safety standards to be adhered, if not they will not allow. the owners don't want a legal case to filed against by labour court.

i learned a lot about the way of life for those people, it's like they don't seem to value human life. it's really sad actually. working in that field became very clear how privileged i am, and the gratitude i felt for my parents (who were poor during growing up) for studying hard while growing up and giving me a good life. safety is a western propoganda. there are few things that are cheaper in this country than life... this is equivalent of writing “om” at start of answer sheet in exam. i get your frustration but the reality is a little more complicated. on major construction projects in the country, both government and private, safety practices are pretty good. i interned at the statue of unity project and have worked for a major private contractor in gujarat and both places had very good health and safety practices.

when it comes to the smaller contractors and smaller projects, the expense of hard hats, boots, glasses, fall protection, etc is way too high. in fact, i have seen on a very small project with a 10 person labor workforce where the owner offered to buy fall protection, hard hats, and boots for the workers and they blatantly refused because they are not comfortable at all in india's extreme heat. they actually threatened to quit if any such compulsory requirement was put on them. the owner offered the workers to work 5am-10pm and 4pm-9pm instead of the 9am-7pm and even that they refused. 

i know, it's crazy to put monetary value to life and safety, but there is no government mandated and enforced regulation for safety. so, the lowest bidder wins. as long as people are willing to work without protection and as long as the government doesn't force it nationwide, there will continue being this issue of neglect. safety gear and procedures are western constructs. indian culture is where you say god's name for protection and have a glass of gaumutra. ^(/s) i am a diy guy and i love watching such videos on yt. it's always a difference to notice between the indian and videshi diy (mostly woodworking kinda stuff) videos. they'd be wearing safety goggles, helmet, field shoes, jeans, jackets, gloves - basically inside some army level armour using a benchsaw kinda thing to cut a stick and meanwhile, my *bharatiya shilpakaar*s will be wearing kachchas and cutting timbers with hacksaw that their carpenter forgot at their house. (obviously a bit of exaggeration but some will definitely be able to relate to this.) a lot of indians come to work in nepal, mainly in construction, carpentry, metal sectors. and what really hurts is seeing little kids and young adults use heavy/loud tools, especially while drilling, sawing, or carving granite, marble etc. they work without protecting their ears and eyes. every time i see someone being so careless, i try to make a point. poor fellows simply don't have any idea about the damages they incur without using noise cancelling headphones and other equipments. [removed] sadly, life is a cheap commodity in india. there was a guy who was painting our house. there was a small bit left for which he said he'd do it after a few days. he didn't show up after those few days. yeah you guessed it right - he had fallen while doing another job and died. just like that. meanwhile we had to suffer the inconvenience of hiring another painter.", maddragon95 fatterthanawhale veertamizhan None goldeneag sleepygamer92 bigplaya6 awakaasprapta None Maddydgr8 GoneHippocamping,safety gear protection construction workers that building homes works country

and then there show which show how a women tolerate domestic violence and stay with her husband. that show boiled my blood. agabai sasubai? i've asked my mom to not check my bags and wallet (only condoms , no cigarette or drugs) and she respects my privacy. i don't have cable only in my house. everyone streams and the tv is for streaming or gaming you have no idea how popular such kind of serials are especially amongst the girls and women. it's like a ritual in most houses where the daughter and mother wait for the serial in the evening, while the son/husband have to sit there waiting for the shitshow to end. there is a serial where a husband beats a wife, but then defends her when someone else comes to beat. then proceeds to make a romantic speech about how husband has right to beat wife, but someone who beats others' wife is scum. as if it's the most normal thing in the world.

the previous generation in this country is fucked in the head beyond redemption. what is the washroom for vats i read this on askreddit. a guys best friend died at 17. a week later, the best friends mom called him and said ""i have to go to his stuff to see what i want to keep. can you check first and throw out anything i should not be seeing?""

21dec1989,2020-03-09,Non-Political,158,1950,False,"i live and work in shenzhen, china and was traveling for work in the us when the virus epidemic happened in china. since it was chinese new year holidays, i thought i’ll head to bali (via hk) for a short vacay and then head back to shenzhen.
as the news of the epidemic becoming severe, i decided to go back to bangalore,india.

this is where the fun starts:
- on february 6, i land in bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am i coming from and i say bali and he let’s me go. (no temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and i had to report myself that i live in china, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to china after jan 24

a week later i have a bad cold (i have a weak immunity) and since i have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so i call the helpline and they ask me if i spoke any hindi (i didn’t) and they disconnected..
so i went to the official government center (rajiv gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
the staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest x-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.so i was isolated and quarantined.

my family were not happy that i reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

the quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
i was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
it was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since i live in a joint family here in blr.

tldr; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

if you have symptoms, report yourself.",my covid-19 quarantine experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/," appreciate u going the extra mile to ensure safety of u and others > so i call the helpline and they ask me if i spoke any hindi (i didn’t) and they disconnected 

this is just disturbing to me. i understand many of the helpline workers they could scramble last moment may have been hindi speakers, but i would assume they would atleast transfer you to someone who speaks your language or english. just the idea that a caller from karnataka calling in an emergency situation is required to know hindi just baffles me. i traveled from shanghai to india on 5th of february for an un avoidable reason and faced a very similar experience.     
     
i went straight to the immigration and asked them where do i need to report. then they scrambled to setup the check up procedures.   
    

the authorities were very oblivious of the situation. the medical team was chatting in their room, totally unaware of passengers arrival. there was no proper guidance for arriving passengers. and i had to hear some horrible bigoted comments from the officials during the time of immigration clearance.    
   

saw reports saying that a medical team will contact me at home to monitor my health. but nobody contacted me their either.   
   
i didn’t have any symptoms or infection, but i was worried and self isolated myself for the next 5 days, until my return flight to shanghai.    
     
during this whole situation i had to go through so much of racist comments and rumours about china and chinese on social media and it felt so disgusting. this was an opportunity to see how the world will behave at crisis.   
    
now back in shanghai, back to work safe and sound.   
since factories are running on low capacity, the pollution levels are so low and i can finally see the blue skies around here.   
    
the preparedness and medical infra in china is manifold efficient than ours. i seriously hope that covid19 doesn’t spread in india. we certainly ~~can~~ can’t handle this well. i dont understand the logic of people not reporting , or running away from hospital , if you are affected , thats your best option for own survival , even if safety of your loved ones is not considered. > my family were not happy 

would they have preferred that you make everyone sick ? smh did you have to pay for your quarantine and tests ? thanks for sharing. how is life living in china and working there? how easy is it to get visa? if you like, do share that experience also... what was the total cost and who paid the bill? certainly sounds like indian immigration. they must handpick the laziest, nastiest and most corrupt of our bureaucrats for those roles. > so i call the helpline and they ask me if i spoke any hindi (i didn’t) and they disconnected

Bitter_Plate,2020-04-13,Non-Political,69,73,False,"i'm only saying it seems like a stupid decision to me and not actually calling others stupid so please don't feel offended.

most people that i have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

i ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. i also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

it's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what i feel.

i completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. by no means am against them, just sharing what i think.

let me know what you think?",buying a car in india seems a stupid decision to me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0hyb8/buying_a_car_in_india_seems_a_stupid_decision_to/," the convenience of owning a car that fits your budget(maintenance included) trumps everything else. buying comes with bit of a disadvantage like dealing with shitty insurance companies and greedy service centers but those are lesser evils compared to dealing with zoomcar customer support, rude ola drivers, allow-me-to-rip-you-off auto drivers  and overcrowded buses. private car ownership is still the best way to get around the city and people are willing to stretch more than needed to attain it. don't know about other cities but atleast in bengaluru, please dont buy a car. bmtc is improving so is the bike rental convenience.

especially if you're a bachelor, instead of spending 6+ lakhs on a car, you might as well spend a bit more on a flat/hostel closer to your workplace and walk. mate i occasionally commute on my dad's two wheeler when i'm in my hometown because we don't have a car. i fucking hate it. i don't know if you've been on indian streets, but they're really bad.

the dust, ohh god, the dust - my biggest problem. it gets in my face evertime a truck or a bus passes through. fucking hate it. then there's heat. it's just isn't comfortable commuting on a bike in indian summers.

you really are disconnected from the reality. either you don't go out much or you're an nri. car is absolutely a necessity. a driver and a car is one of those luxuries that have completely changed my life for the better. i have a 45min to 1hr commute to work in horrible traffic and i already hate driving. having a driver has allowed me to be calmer and more relaxed. i'm able to use the time in the car more productively and i dont have to worry about fucking parking. i don't like smelly ubers, broken suspensions, lack of seatbelts and safety, uncouth drivers and their antics everyday. thank you but i shall have my car every day of the week. context: first car was a nano (still my favourite), then bought an xcent cng for long drives. 

i used to travel in uber, autos and buses (city doesn't have metro). 

having a car is absolutely essential in india. public transport is unsafe, unreliable and expensive. the cost per kilometer for even the cheapest uber or auto is more than rs. 20 in my city, and i get a smelly car or auto with a rash driver.

when i bought a nano, it literally unlocked a lot of freedom for me. i could visit a movie with my friends without worrying about the 500 rs 1 way uber fare. i could pick parents from the airport. i could go on long drives without worrying about the crappy cars from zoomcar breaking down. 

yes, i used zoomcar till 2016 and i was utterly disappointed by the quality of cars. one ecosport we rented had a broken headlight dangling from the side, completely bald tire, and we paid more than 3500 for 1 day of driving. the car broke down mid way. i vowed never to use that service again. 

buy a cheap car. don't spend a lot of money on it. your friends may tell you that a 3 lakh bike looks sexier and you can do ladakh trips, but bikes are the most unsafe and uncomfortable means of transport in a nation with the highest road fatalities. oh,about safety, almost all cars by maruti are 0 rated for crash tests, so might as well buy a nano. if not, get something from hyundai or tata or mahindra, preferably used. 

the cost of ownership of a car, including everything, for a 1 lakh kilometer ownership period, is around rs. 10 per km. this is for a 7-8 lakh rs. car on petrol. on my xcent, the cost of running is rs. 3 per km. that's 7 times cheaper than the uber fares without surge rates. there are a lot of intangible benefits that come from vehicle ownership including utility, convenience and transporting family and stuff in bulk. 

availability : try getting to work in an ola or zoomcar on a rainy day. 

besides there are a handful of sexual positions that are only possible in car ;) 2 wheelers don't protect you from rain, sun and dust

booking uber takes above 30 minutes and it runs at about rs 40/km in hyderabad. struggling daily for 30 min just to book an uber to/from office is sub optimal

pooled transportation requires you to depend on someone else and/or the route means you often spend 20 min extra each way

at some point in life, it's worth spending money on non necessities. even if someone is spending a years salary on a car they'll use for 5 years, it may be worth it for them. live in delhi, metro works for me in 95% of the cases, rest i use auto or cab. so i basically have 0 need for a car. cars or anything else, if you need it, you buy it. if you buy stuff without necessity, that person is dumb imho. judging a purchase based on costs is not good. a house could take almost 5-10 years to pay, that doesn't mean it's not worth it.

that needed to be said. bollywood is fucking cesspool of degenerates spreading their filth in simpleton gullible youth of india.

this thing need to be made a big issue, because they have big hand in rapes happening in india. i think tollywood is also a big part of this, just look at the posters of movies they sexualise the women way too much i hate buzzfeed india but this is something i totally agree with. bollywood is a broken industry with a lot of cracks this being the largest. bollywood=crapwood when people were talking about horrific rape scenes in got, it seemed tame compared to the bollywood and other regional indian films of the 80s and 90s. telegu cinema is worse. at 5:21 it's said that ""it is scientifically proven that watching aggression increases the tendency of aggression"". does anyone have a source on this?

disclaimer: this is not whataboutism, i absolutely hate mainstream bollywood movies as well. you can't pick and choose.

either movies influence people in their real life or they don't. you can't pick and choose topics to be mad about. 

i have no problem with either. we as people should choose what to watch. i don't watch most hindi movies because most of them are bad.

you need to make them feel like a fool, while you can't keep on fighting with those idiots individually, shame them on a place where they are together. much easier :) they always wanted to get rid of your cats but didn't have the chance so they are using corona as a scapegoat to get them out. first unspoken rule of the internet - don't f*** with cats. i personally always avoid the topic of religion in my family because they are barely religious (muslims) while i’m basically an atheist. but whenever i do encounter an annoying religious uncle/aunt, i always stand my ground and not attend prayers and absolutely avoid any speck of religion from my conversations if i can avoid it.

if you are older (above 18 years), you gotta look visibly different and defiant to diffuse the festering cultish environment. a part of the reason these toxic mentality happens is because nobody is there to ask questions. people keep saying “yes!” to every mindless idea, and then everyone’s iq starts dropping fast.

start saying “that’s such a stupid belief, use your god given brains! ”. i hear you brother/sister.

jags1611,2020-04-06,Non-Political,77,137,False,"quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( professors, scientists, military historians )

now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""what are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""what are some badass tweets during covid-19"". it's filled with young indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

what's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. there are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-hindus and liberals in almost every problem. 

my personal experience : 1) a guy literally wrote an answer saying italians are victims of coronavirus because they are liberals. a commentor on same answer even wrote that italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". both of them were indians.

2) many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) one guy literally posted tweets from bjp trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  multiple answers ""completely"" blaming muslims for coronavirus ( tablighi jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

i have been banned maybe 30 to 40 times in the past 2 years, sometimes for  offending some right wing indians sentiments for the simplest of reasons. 

i got banned last week for an answer to a question: why are most of left journalists biased against india?

this was my response copy paste:

they're not. indians are so conservative, so obsessed with culture and heritage that anything that even goes slightly against their traditions or establishment becomes left wing propoganda.

the most left leaning journalist in india would be considered right leaning in the western nations, and left journalists that you take for granted in europe or america would get shot or stabbed in india within a week of publishing their articles or stating their opinion.

next thing i know i have been donwvoted four times in the span of the next two hours and eventually banned. 

i challenge the ban and they responded by saying: thank you for your appeal but we stand by our statement.

it can be useful sometimes if you have a specific question in some niche, but you shouldnt ever go there *looking* for good content the worst thing about quora is that it's high on google search rankings. well, quora was great when it was a hidden gem but when the masses arrived there, it lead to mud. indian quora has turned into propaganda platform. some dude posts a fake answer without any proof, then a tweet picks it up and then it goes on whatsapp. somewhere in between deepak chaurasia and sudheer chaudhary pick that answer and run it like a real news. i now remember one more thing  - there were answers glorifying nathuram godse and agreeing with his motives. > quora is still fine if you read posts from non-indian writers although it's sad that the quality of it has declined greatly. 

lol, i agree completely, but i would have gotten skewered for writing this on quora. maybe there were bad writers from other nations too, but i never encountered them. whereas the amount of garbage i came across from indians was overwhelming.

the things you highlight are pretty much the reasons i left.  i joined quora in 2014 - found i had a lot of free time, and it was my first experience with social media (wasn't active on fb, and had deleted my account by then). i ran out of patience 2 years later. people there pride themselves on the site being more intellectual, and there was the odd pocket of brilliance. but it was predominantly of equal quality to political twitter, especially if you're indian. i never have used it and i do not read answers from there as most of them are just copy/paste from other sources. overall it's a shitty website because a lot of indians are misusing it. everyone there thinks they are einstein or newton just by answering a few questions. i left all social networking sites many years ago now i only use youtube and reddit. why quora when you've got reddit.", Meraxes373 rishifilmmaker None PretendExplanation1 roamingoninternet blue_raven007 kingof-potatos jags1611 singarache xataari AfzalOzil360,quora full hate quora used favorite platform back 2014 mainly much new learn answering actually knowledge regarding topic professors scientists military historians now full hate speech low quality answers cringeworthy questions what destruction level 100 tweets what badass tweets covid 19 filled young indians zero knowledge topic hesitate write senseless opinions comment hate what worse fact lot openly spreading religious hate trying influence others regarding beliefs many right left wingers blame childish comments civil debates non existent right wing always finds chance blame non hindus liberals almost every problem personal experience guy literally wrote answer saying italians victims coronavirus liberals commentor answer wrote italians deserve suffering they leftists indians 2 many questions criticizing quickly reported agree stance put secular liberals 3 guy literally posted tweets bjp trolls answer called epic burn badass 4 multiple answers completely blaming muslims coronavirus tablighi jamaat blamed 100 whole religion forget quorans think sort celebrity quora still fine read posts non writers although sad quality declined greatly

my mother on the other hand is on another level she verbally abuses anyone without any reason and she said stupid things to me yesterday to make things worst, i won't talk to her till she apologizes.

as for the earphones, try putting them in and not playing anything. then you'll see that anyone trying to show that they know what you're listening to is full of shit. 

as for the boredom, try taking up a hobby, puzzles or something. crawl under a sofa and stay there. to stave off boredom you can try to recreate the sistine chapel ceiling on the underside of the sofa seat. this should keep you occupied and sane till lockdown ends - which, considering we haven't been able to procure serological testing kits and won't be mass testing anytime soon, will be around 2021. i am sorry you are going through this. i also grew up with a verbally abusive mother and it was'nt untill 25 yrs old and financially independent that i started giving it back to her in kind. thankfully my father would sometimes act as a shield for me. looks like you do not have that option.  

i am thankfull everyday that i don't have to spend the lockdown with her and feel bad for my dad who is stuck with her.

if you have your own room, lock it up for privacy, that’s what i was doing at your age (about 2 years ago). first, they’re were skeptical about me locking the door of my room, now it has become a norm.

and just like how the members of the 1978 jonestown incident commited mass suicide, the people of this country too, will end up commiting (a metaphorical) suicide to this nation.

or perhaps they are too high and drunk on the kool aid to the point they they will still blame these ""external termites"", if this nation ever ends up commiting that said metaphorical suicide.

such a day i suppose, is not that far off.

Sulh-i-kul,2020-04-04,Non-Political,45,154,False,"one of my neighbours and their family are super religious. they conduct loud pujas during navratra, twice a day. they conduct havans, jaaps, jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

when they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, i can hear them yell at each other - all day long. they call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

this made me think - what's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? what would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

and finally, how can indian religions be reformed to make better humans out of us?",opinion: what's the point of being religious if it doesn't rid you of basic human vices?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funn5p/opinion_whats_the_point_of_being_religious_if_it/," they don't connect religious tenets to daily behaviour. each religion has a ritualistic aspect and a moral advisory aspect. it is common for people to focus on the former and forget the latter. this is because identifying with a religion no longer means following moral tenets. it means fulfilling the ritual aspects. this shift has occurred with the growth of population and religious propagation. fuck every religion imma be atheists from now let me step aside a bit and go on a tangent : the boon and bane with indian religions ,at least with the collective we now term as hinduism , is that there is no central authority or guiding figure .

ofc , there are gurus for each sect which can sort of fulfill the gap and act as a potential figurehead , but since the religion is so diverse that people have been interpreting it in their own way. heck sometimes even between families the customs vary greatly.

also since there is no ""proof"" of eternal damnation like abrahamic religions folk aren't afraid of being judged. it is basically upto you to be good. worse comes to worse they think they will born as a bug or something in the next round.

coming back to the original question , religions can and will never get rid of human vices, cuz that is what makes us humans. but it can keep it in check which almost all religions are advocating for  

the point according to the pooja practioner  is to keep the gods happy and no matter what they do they will be forgiven, this seems to be a major trait in all religions.

as far as indian religions are considered, they need to unify and get under a common umbrella, by unify i mean mentally and not only in fb groups  and spew venom over other religions. cut the caste divide , intermarry ,blur it out. there are a lot of spaces for improvement, like the sikh brothers, their sense of community is far greater than any other indian religion. 

take care of local temples , own them , make community participate etc . give easily digestable forms of scriptures to the young ones, which gives them a sense of right and wrong from a ethical point of view and not a reward punishment view.

having said all this, it is always difficult to contain what goes on inside a person's mind when he is down or angry. spirituality will only help so much. ill just leave one of my poems here. :)

the problem of blind religion.

(i am the big bang - part 3)


myself i saw and slowly i understood,

the challenge of science was clear to me,

the problem of religion though,

was another twisted strange mystery. 


with strange twists of chance and fate,

i stumbled upon the key in my dark journeys,

all truths are but half truths said the world,

while the mirror told me all lies are but half lies,


with this key embedded in my mind,

the books of religion now made sense,

the truth was hidden so clearly all along,

its discovery blew away all my pretence.


half the truth lay in one book,

half in the others across the earth,

half the lies were in all the pages,

such complications, people called the books dirt.


religion, oh this strange puzzle piece,

the truth was told to them halfly indeed,

the power of the truth is very strong,

half they were told so it may not be abused for greed. 


some were told we were made in one's image,

some were told we are many and the one,

some were told this is all an illusion,

while some were told the all is only one.


the key is to understand them all,

to see the constant truth hidden therein,

to kill the evil child of hate in your mind,

only then do you find one's paradise within.


those who blindly believed without reason,

couldn't believe their books could ever hold lies,

those who reasoned without understanding belief,

saw in these truthful books only wishful cries,


such is the sad tale of religion and its blind preachers,

and of the ignorant innocent believers trying to ascend,

instead of uniting they separate and fight,

now with every other step they do further descend.


the light of the truth made readers close their own eyes,

blind are now most available preachers,

the truth was but right in front of them,

but it's brightness even blinded true seekers.


inevitable this blind war was, 

the one this always knew,

he had hidden the truth too well,

but this was out of necessity too.


while science arrogantly closed its ears to wisdom,

religion innocently chose by itself to be blind,

the illuminati, seeing both sides clearly,

out of fear don't clearly speak their mind.


the one is in you, the one is in me,

the one is also in the bronze of your penny,

nothing could ever be outside of the one,

for within the one does the all rest as the many religion is evil. this country badly needs an atheist movement. to wash away the ""sins"" apparently... i think that religion often offers a kind of meaning to life, ( not a very strong argument)
and one of the comments said that we need an atheist revolution in india. a place where public life and religion are so intricately intermeshed into the public sphere, and it allows a person to self actualise in that condition many people are afraid to let go of their traditions.
moreover, many people say that colonialism directly impacted the growth of religious sensitivities in india. after colonialism, hindus and muslim became much more conscious of their identities and began to formulate movements based on those identities instead of cultural and linguistic affinities.

so i know i'm pretty old now but i'm planning to put up profiles on dating websites - i heard tinder, aisle and hinge are good.

and also parents are putting up my profile on shaadi.com, jeevansaathi.com and bharatmatrimony.com.


please help me with what are your experiences with both!

have any of you found serious relationships via a dating website - what are the things i can do to be safe on there.?

and have any of you actually gotten married via above mentioned matrimonial sites?
will it be bad if i am the one operating the profile, i know people tend to be pretty conservative!",dating and matrimonial sites,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fc7h8e/dating_and_matrimonial_sites/," hi dear as an active 35+ guy on tinder, please do not confuse tinder/aisle/hinge/आदि with shaadi and matrimonial sites. 

good luck otherwise, finding whatever you are looking for. rip inbox i think the chances of getting someone to marry from tinder would be pretty low. put more emphasis on platforms where people would come with the mindset to marry. *\*grabs popcorn\**

oh wait, this post will get on front page. it is not fun:

if you are looking for men in the 28-40 bracket, beware of married men using dating apps. they suck. verify people on social media as best you can. many married men are utter buffoons, it takes less than a minute to find their wives on instagram or facebook. 

unless you are 100% sure that the dude is not a sex offender, do not be alone with him. make sure you have friends on standby and the dude knows that he won’t be able to get away with bad behaviour. the police will be unsympathetic if anything were to happen, so minimise the risk as best you can. 

i cannot stress this enough: have an exit strategy prepared and consider not consuming alcohol the first few times you meet a match.

if you get unsolicited pictures or horrible messages, report and keep records. if you’re looking to get married then matrimonial sites would be better for you.

dating sites especially in india aren’t the best way to look for a spouse. not saying you can’t get one. people do get married after meeting on tinder but in india, for obvious reasons that isn’t the best choice. 

dating involves time. marriages in india don’t. i met my wife on tinder. we dated for 3 years and have been married for one year now. all the best...

my personal experience meeting people on dating sites has been from bad to worse.

either i met complete psychopaths, or lunatics; sometimes both! don't consider 28 to be 'old'. don't pressure yourself into getting married because you feel 'time is running out'. 

rather have a mindset that you will not make any compromises in your life partner. 

getting married is easy, but so is getting divorced or worse, spending a life in an unhappy marriage. 28f

first of all, please note that this is a composite shot, meaning the stars and the moon were shot separately and then blended together for artistic effect.

##equipment-
nikon d3100, nikkor 70-300mm lens, a cheap ass tripod, one remote shutter

##software-
pipp, autostakkert, lightroom, photoshop

##exif-
f/11, 1/800x 600 exposures, iso 800

##process-
1)getting the focus right is the singular biggest challenge while shooting the moon, so i spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible

2) took more than 600 exposures of the moon, and 120 dark frames

3) put all these into pipp, which aligns all the exposures easily and uses the dark frames to reduce some noise

4) next, the aligned frames are imported to autostakkert, which stacks all the frames together. it basically takes the average of all the exposures to increase the signal to noise ratio(snr) of the final resulting image

5) final processing done in lightroom, then added the star background and blended the two shots together in photoshop.



if you have any  questions/doubts or if i have made a mistake in the above explanation, please do tell me :) we take these images for granted. never knew how hard it was to get the end result. what causes the difference? it's remarkable!! it was cloudy here!!

if you are indeed talking about our planet and you are indeed in india, take all precaution you can by avoiding contact with others during this week, upcoming week and upcoming months.

**february** \- air pollution is pretty much the same. weather starts to a get a bit warmer in late feb.

**march** \- again same, though some days pm 2.5 reaches 150 +

**may and june** \- pm 2.5 is mostly above 200. dust storms also occurs, due to winds flowing from rajasthan. this year, pm 2.5 went above 500.

**july** \- this is the least polluted month, due to monsoons. the whole month of july, pm 2.5 stays around 40-60, which is considered safe.

**august and september** \-  again same, pm 2.5 is around 150 on average.

**october and november** \- most polluted months of the year, due to diwali. pm 2.5 is usually around 200, but the day after diwali, delhi becomes a gas chamber. pm 2.5 levels touches 900-1000+.

**december** \- cold winter starts to kick in, skies starts to appear more blue, air also feels great because it so cold. pm 2.5 levels are on the lower end, around 100.

this program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: windows, linux, os x) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- due to current pandemic crisis of covid-19: a severe lockdown has been placed in india such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, bigbasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. however, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



some of the key features includes:

1. cross platform system wide notifications.
1. you can login via otp all by the terminal itself.
1. ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. polling is done via api endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


due to the current pandemic crisis of covid-19, i advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

i have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, however if you have any ideas to improve the section - feel free to send a pr.

the program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

if you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

okay_12345,2020-04-06,Science/Technology,30,19,False,"i'm a grade 12 student ,currently prepping for jee advanced ,got a decent but not great percentile in jee mains (99.87) ,should be able to get top nits for computer science . seeing from the trends of my mock adv tests , i should be able to get into some core iit if not the absolute best ones(bombay ,delhi ). i also applied to some usa unis not that seriously as a back up option .but surprisingly got into carnegie mellon's school of computer science (supposedly one of the top cs programs in the world ) . what do you think my decision should be ?",carnegie mellon vs iit/nit,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvvgvx/carnegie_mellon_vs_iitnit/," an undergraduate degree at cmu might set you back by at least $350,000 over 4 years. that's almost 3 crores if you take the exchange rate to be 80 (which it will reach soon). you might get a chance to work in the us, or apply for a masters/phd there. if you can afford the fees, that might be a good option. but remember that the average pay would be close to $60k in hand ($100k gross), which means that the payback will run into a decade, unless you manage to increase your salary substantially. also, you never know what the visa situation will be like. 

  
cs at an nit is also a good option. much cheaper, and has a lot of brand recognition. 

call me biased, but the best professionals i have interacted with have studied at an iit- especially the older ones (kharagpur, delhi, mumbai, kanpur and guwahati). **i'm not an iitan so don't make troll posts stating that i'm being elitist.**

i have done a phd from a top university abroad, and even here, if you have a degree from an iit, it really makes the bored professor smile in appreciation. the advantage of an iit is that it has the best peer group you can get at your age. and these are the folks who usually get the top spots at graduate programs abroad. you may not get computer science, but you can try getting a minor in the subject and seek a job that's into any field of applied engineering. 

a lot of people will tell you that iits are hyped and low in ranking etc. please understand that rankings are based on research output, the number of international students and professors etc. they are not based on student quality or jobs they get after graduation. rich universities game the system, while those in developing countries like india suffer. 

all in all, it is a good dilemma to have. personally, i find it risky to spend 3 crores on an undergraduate degree. if you want to go to the us or eu or some other country, get a masters or a phd from there after doing your ug from here. cmu. hands down. 
great school. you'll have a great experience. 
however, the program is intense. so just fyi. 

p.s: i got into bit after 12th then dropped out after 2 semesters. gave my sat and went off to michigan. if you can afford it, cmu. otherwise iit. step1: finance available- check.

step2: curriculum
      cmu - https://csd.cmu.edu/academic/undergraduate/bachelors-curriculum-admitted-2018
        iit b - https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/documents/btech2013curriculum-after-ugpc-comments.pdf

step3: if you want to really learn the discipline of  engineering go to cmu. as stated by experts the payback period is longer but you'll know to tackle the top level problems. your approach towards engineering problems will be much better when you join the industry.

 if you want to do more of traditional engineering and bag high package placements go to iits.

good luck. academics wise, i would say it really shouldn't make much of a difference for your ug degree. but the extra curricular activities, clubs, societies that any western university provides are the real game changer. you'll slog in iit and cmu, but at the end, you'll have accomplished more in cmu than in iit.

the biggest issue with studying abroad is the expense, especially when it comes to usa. but if you get a scholarship, that should ease a lot of the burden. carnegie mellon any day, especially if you want to pursue ai/ml. the environmental exposure and peer group will be outstanding, some of the greatest minds across the world.  you kind of get this at iits too but most students generally tend to slack off until they reach their penultimate years of undergrad.

it's a great roi if you can afford it. if you do well and play your cards right at cmu it won't be hard getting into top companies like faang or start-ups with high pay grade. totally worth it over considering ms at cmu after iit undergrad. applying to masters even through an iit is very hard to get accepted, it will need a lot of effort on your side in terms of extra-curricular and research work.

p.s: i'm an iit undergrad currently developing my profile and aspiring to get into ms ml at cmu. carnegie mellon since most of the iitians and nitians end up going abroad, i would say skip that step completely dependends on what are your goals and ambitions but anyday cmu>>iit's cmu ranks 1^st in the world for its computer science program. since, most of the iitians try their hard to get cmu for their ms, you are basically getting a head start. also, you'll not need require ms to immigrate as you'll already be in the usa for 4 years. also, the best thing is you'll grow so much as a person during the 4 years. 

cmu is costly, that's a fact. however, majority of cmu people end up at faang so paying back the money would not be that hard.

i'll also be joining cmu scs (masters) in the next session. bruh what's your sat score", None Dhammasevak rahulthewall akashkumarhulk kfpswf Nik_V_9 vasusood khart0907 Ash_Sss ShinigamiBK201 steveaugustine9,carnegie mellon vs iit nit grade 12 student currently prepping jee advanced got decent great percentile jee mains 99 87 should able top nits computer science seeing trends mock adv tests able core iit absolute best ones bombay delhi applied usa unis seriously back option but surprisingly got carnegie mellon school computer science supposedly top cs programs world think decision

a medical scientist researching infectious disease, for the us government in houston who was my classmates in college.

and our friendships are equally deep after his departure to america.

got a call from him.

his first sentence was,

""devendra ji,

* our pm modi is some great man, probably.

i said

""hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

he said, ""we have been doing research in india for the last 30 years on infectious disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

i asked, ""are you also making fun of modi like seculars, leftists, muslims, thukde thukde gang, urban naxalites, award returning gangs, aap, ndtv etc in india?""

he said, ""oh nothing like that, i and my whole family have been citizens of america for 19 years, my annual salary is more than 15 crores in indian rupees, but the hearts are still indian.

every major step and decision of modi is completely separated from politics, i wish the welfare of india and human beings i also saw lakhs of indians are making fun of modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, but in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of modi.

you would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on covid 19 in particular,

all scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, because covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

in such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, currency notes, files, courier parcels, steering wheels of vehicles viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, and without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by modi, since there is no loss of work due to sunday,

* the country will be almost free from viruses! * these ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

if any of his advisors has given this advice to modi then this person is entitled to the nobel prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of modi, then he should get the nobel prize for medicine for his contribution in the medical field of infectious disease. ""*

i could not even speak a word.

here, crores of people of my country are making fun of modi, humiliating him as illiterate,

i was wondering how do other countries deal with science and research in that it requires mastery of the english language? 

are there any of india’s researches done in script? 

this is to help me teach others and also wonder how a filipino could go about conducting research.

research papers are meant to be read by other researchers in the field (not common people) so that they can know what the author has done, and the findings have to be accepted by the entire scientific community around the world which has english as its common language.

for common people, what we need to do right now is **science communication** in their local languages. that means we must tell about our research to the people around us in their local languages. and every researcher should consider science communication as their duty to make people aware of the advancements in science. **only then will it be beneficial to the society**.

yotegixiga,2020-04-05,Science/Technology,25,14,False,"i am a native of uttar pradesh and have worked here in noida for more than a year. there are a couple of things i like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

i'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category i'd be looking for) and should be my choice above ncr. some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

here's what i pay for in noida -

rent for 3 bhk (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. electricity is cheap. gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

what's the equivalent for bangalore?

&#x200b;

drawbacks - too few companies to apply for.

&#x200b;

edit: from top-tier college. i make around 1.2 lac inr per month

&#x200b;

you, if you're in blr, what's your opinion on this?","people in tech, would you choose noida or bangalore for a job",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9xsd/people_in_tech_would_you_choose_noida_or/," stick to noida. it's cheaper and you will be near your family. 

you can save a lot. what are your priorities? from what you've mentioned it looks like lesser expenses. bangalore is way more expensive to live. having lived and worked at both places, bangalore any fucking day! noida is cheaper, noida might have family. but the quality of work, companies, peer group etc. bangalore beats the shit out of noida. also, less pollution, far better weather conditions, work environment, cosmopolitan structure etc. 

however if your family is near delhi, noida stay here as you are going to save more and can look after them bangalore is pretty much the best city in india for an engineering job if you cannot find a decent job in your hometown.

 traffic is screwed up, but if you live close to work, you can take care of that. it is expensive but there are ways to save if you want. 

work life is screwed up too. i would choose living close to your home over bangalore any day if you have a decent job. comparisons based on my limited experience across the two cities:

* **colleagues:**
   * noida / gurgaon: *generally* a very crass crowd, inconsiderate, boorish, non-diverse.  office colleagues are combatant and passive-aggressive, constantly at each others' throats. this also extends beyond the workplace and applies to the general populace. exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.
   * blr: generally a more refined, laid-back crowd, quite diverse. this also extends to the general populace, except auto-rickshaw drivers and drivers in general. exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.  

* **jobs and pay:**
   * noida / gurgaon: very less options for switching. pay upwards of 30l is hard to find.
   * blr: can switch every 6 months if one wants to. pay upwards of 30l is a piece of cake (after a certain yoe).  

* **housing & rent:**
   * noida / gurgaon: lots of new apartments with great construction quality available at affordable rents. impossible to find same brackets and similar value in bangalore.
   * blr: quality housing is available but the inventory is smaller than n/g's, and it costs a bomb. i've found that a kick-ass, shiny gurgaon 3bhk which goes for inr 25k per month is inr 40-50k (at least) in bangalore, for a similar or shittier apartment.  

* **transport, roads, traffic:**
   * noida / gurgaon: better roads, better public transport, and even though traffic can get crazy, it's not as bad as bangalore's.
   * blr: pathetic roads, brutal, never-ending congestion in places like silk board, varthur road, kr puram flyover etc.  

* **food:**
   * noida / gurgaon: great quality and variety of food. tons of options, even in the sub <200 price bracket, there is great quality food available.
   * blr: not fit for human consumption, unless you are willing to shell out serious dough. i've found that quality food (beautifully prepared and true to the authentic cuisine, hygienic, perfect proportions and taste, generous quantity) begins above the inr 500 mark, sometimes more.

i personally cared about peers (and thus office culture) and money a lot more, hence i prioritized 1 and 2 over everything else and worked towards fixing issues related to housing, traffic and food. unless you get a 40-50 % increment, stick to noida. how many years experience do you have ? 

bangalore definitely has better salary, more job options, etc. but has become extremely expensive to raise kids, run a big family, etc. also the traffic is simply not worth all the extra money in my personal perspective. if you are looking for a short stint of 2-3 years as a bachelor it might work out, but you may not want to go out of bangalore after that, however bad it is. the place has a magical quality like that, which is quite tough to get out of. definitely nodia. because of the following reasons: 

- better public transport (delhi metro is world class and dtc buses are awesome. you can also go for e-ricks and autos are cheaper than bangalore) 

- house rents are cheap, compared to bangalore. and availability is awesome.

- winter in delhi lasts from 2nd week of october to 1st week or april. that is 6 months of awesome, chilly weather. 

- social life in delhi pretty good and usually have more options than bangalore.

- delhi has better access to green spaces and public parks. 

on the contrary, here are some reasons i wouldn't go for delhi/noida: 

- despite 6 months of chilly weather, the other 6 months can be quite hot. loo winds in may and june will raise temps to 45 - 50 degrees. july to september will be humid as fuck. 

- pollution. nothing to say about this. air quality suffers for 4 weeks in october and generally, it's pretty bad throughout the year. bangalore is as cheap as noida. i’ve lived in both places, culturally opposite for obvious reasons. bangalore is good for a short 3-4 yrs stint.", notanothervoice None chalkrow Pr0066 LE_AVIATOR gptz psankar reva_r spinachpop,tech would choose noida bangalore job native uttar pradesh worked noida year couple things here namely cheap economy cheap rent great housing newly constructed apartments great infrastructure water gas electricity top tier engineering college decent pay looking change job around start 2021 colleagues recommended bangalore lot opportunities in category d looking for choice ncr already mostly came families advice so here pay noida rent 3 bhk larger living area 18000 6 kms office takes 20 minutes reach 150 rupee split among two per side uber electricity cheap gas pipeline way cheaper cylinders used homes what equivalent bangalore x200b drawbacks companies apply for x200b edit top tier college make around 2 lac inr per month x200b you blr what opinion this

[poor ux of a fairly popular indian bank's online platform](https://reddit.com/link/ftn4l0/video/feawzp2jfhq41/player)

as seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. and input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. i'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious ui, but you get the gist.

if they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, i wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

there's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. do you append a number to your password and increment it? well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by nist](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-faq/#q-b05). i feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

now, i'd like for this to be more than a rant, so if any of you run in circles which can help usher in an improvement here, let's discuss.",why are the net banking sites absolute and utter garbage to use?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftn4l0/why_are_the_net_banking_sites_absolute_and_utter/," i can understand your frustration. however, my money is still on corporation bank which has the ugliest ux and last but not least a pop up with ""speak to your branch manager"" for miniscule requests as well! also fucking irctc. evey time they update it. they make it worse. icici used to be semi-decent but now there is so much unrelated stuff cluttering the page...ads for stuff, loan offers, whatnot, and no way to remove it or disable the sections you don't need. the problem is not the bank but the agency they hire for the web design. such people should be identified and  publicly shamed. most of the banking and government website feels like they haven't been updated since 90s. kotak is good. hdfc bad. having only used icici and sbi and no, i don't want home loans, education loans, car loans, credit card etc. all i want to log in pay or transfer money that is it. i think sbi is slightly less cluttered than icici and don't even get me started with marquee. both my accounts are dormant because i hate using them. for banking apps ui is not the main priority. check pages of international banks having banking facility in india. when i shifted from icici to hdfc, i really use to hate the ui of hdfc bank's website. but right now i feel more secure doing netbanking through hdfc than icici. their secret text and picture is just amazing, i don't have to fear about website spoofing which is one my major concern when using a not so known website. plus their support team is amazing i asked for a feature and they put it in their next release. different businesses have different priorities don't judge on the same criteria. दlit engineers", sansays Android5511 de_redditor Barely_Excited bunnykumarxyz katlaki OddlyImpressive irajputra,net banking sites absolute utter garbage use pity applications used millions daily managing essential part livelihoods shit ux really best come with seriously think average middle schooler slightest experience web probably come better overall design implementation shudder x200b poor ux fairly popular bank online platform reddit link ftn4l0 video feawzp2jfhq41 player seen above revealing options select dropdowns requires special tricks input fields actually trigger sidebars or dropdown already cramped box form generally follows function seems developers finacle edgeverve finacle corporate banks concerned adding wave effect buttons slide transition menus actually testing rubbish d give another fifteen instances atrocious ui gist can t easier parts writing web app right wonder sort nightmare realm exists back end there course trend forcing users update passwords every quarter so append number password increment well do shit form security advised nist pages nist gov 800 63 faq q b05 feel non tech savvy folks probably writing passwords somewhere instead using manager banks double require separate sign transaction passwords rules naturally now d rant run circles help usher improvement here let discuss

https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies/new?providers=hsd,hst i got excited because of duck tales but it's the 2017 show, not the old one. other than the mandalorian is there anything good to watch all the marvel shows will take at-least 6 months to come out and all the other stuff is for kids when's the official launch date again? disney has got art attack rights? that's awesome. i spent my childhood watching that show. now i can get back to watching that during this ```social distancing```


any idea if the marvel animated shows, like ultimate spiderman, avengers emh, or avengers assemble will be coming on this? where is clone wars and simpsons? they have clone wars tv show?",

***by: kartikeya semwal***

with the ever-increasing threat posed by china’s pla navy in the ioc (indian ocean region), neighbouring countries like japan, south korea and australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. till now, none of these countries has an operational aircraft carrier (ac). instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or als (amphibious landing ships).

[ins vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

but more than them, india feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 aircraft carriers (acs). currently, indian navy has a solo ac called ins vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from russia. by 2022, india will get its 2nd ac which is its own indigenous ac called ins vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. now since india has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 ac fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[india's indigenous aircraft carrier ins vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe pakistan doesn’t have an ac of its own. opposite to that, china currently has 2 acs namely laoning & shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. with this, china’s power projection through it’s pla navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including india. china is working on getting 2 more acs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of ioc. till date, ioc has been guarded by india navy in coordination with japanese & south korean navy. 

[pla navy ac shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

indian navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of pla navy & to effectively guard the ioc region, it needs a 3rd ac which if accepted by govt. of india (goi); will be india’s 2nd indigenous ac called ins vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. the only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. due to this reason, goi is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd ac for indian navy.

[india-australia navy officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

but there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an ac jointly by 4 nations namely india, australia, japan & south korea. indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. this will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. i am hereby sharing the following points about it:-it can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. having a joint ac will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. it can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as japan for its electrical & electronic parts, australia and south korea for their weapon packages & crew and india for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best ac built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. a huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 south asian countries. that will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. automatic threat-neutralisation from china’s pla navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint ac as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[f-35 b taking off from us aircraft carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

one point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as lockheed martin’s f-35bs or the 4+ generation boeing’s f/a-18 super hornet block-iii. now except india, all 3 countries have already ordered f-35as for their airforce’ modernization plans. so they can easily get the f-35bs which have been specially designed to be operated from acs. 

but again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint ac which in-turn won’t be feasible. add to it, while the other 3 countries are also nato members, us won’t be willing to allow access of f-35bs with indian navy officers & sailors on the ac as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of f-35bs, which they might share with iaf, drdo & hal to help them make their own 5th generation amca (advanced medium combat aircraft). 

[f\/a-18 super hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

on the other hand, opting for f/a-18 super hornet block-iii would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. the us won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to indian navy and indian airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. indian navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of super hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts.

now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the chinese threat in ioc. it is only a matter of time coz once if pla navy gets its 3rd ac possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. but if india, japan, australia and south korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint ac & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then china would think twice before messing with it.",how bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for ioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuv5y8/how_bout_quadnation_aircraft_carrier_for_ioc/," japan is under us military umbrella, not to mention that us has bases in all these countries..they don't need us. us seventh fleet operates out of japan. japan has large ""helicopter carriers"" which i'm sure can embark the stol version of the f-35. 

south korea comes under the us umbrella and can ask for protection at any time should they require it. 

australia also has a couple of helo carriers they can embark the f-35 on. 

all in all, the ultimate way to beat a chinese naval force in those waters is not with the brute force if an aircraft carrier but with multiple sea denial actions wherein the chinese carriers are not allowed to operate freely. 

for example, patrolling the strait of malacca effectivepy can quickly put an end to any ambition of putting chinese carriers in the indian ocean. which is why the base in the andamans is insanely important. also, many countries in that region are not that close to china. should there be any aggression, you can almost guarantee support because they're also in the line of fire. don't you think we need hospitals and schools/ colleges more than we need aircraft carriers? the military might of usa didn't protect their population from unemployment, poverty or a dangerously stupid president elected by an illiterate & brainwashed voter base. just consider onething: our navy doesn't need more than 3 carriers at all. 1 for east, 1 for west, and one of the three is always at maintenance. carriers just don't justify the cost that they incur. carriers are good for offence, but what we are looking for is defence. if our carriers are anyways going to stay near our coasts during defence then why not launch plames from the coast itself. america won't less india f-35's.

i'm no one to tell what should or shouldn't be researched. my biggest issue is the quality of research which would go into this.

but seeing [these](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/science-congress-shocked-at-lectures-on-ravanas-airports-modi-waves/articleshow/67412322.cms) kind of things doesn't give me any confidence.

i hope (but don't have a lot of expectations) that these researches break the superstitions which exist in india.

they could even manipulate the research to justify the superstitions and hindutva ideology. this kind of thing is being done in arab countries too. see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camel_urine

there even have been research in it. e.g., see here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=camel+urine

basically, finding a good use for the bovine excretory products is a must if banning of cow-slaughter is to be made economically viable at all. so the government pretty much doesn't have a choice but to throw good money (which we don't have much of!) at literally researching cow/bull shit.

i myself have wondered whether the dung of grass-fed cows could have a positive effect on our gut microbiome. maybe this is the principle behind panchagavya. never had the guts to find out for myself. apparently [fecal transplant](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/clinical_services/advanced_endoscopy/fecal_transplantation.html) is a thing in medicine though. there’s a reason why india isn’t considered as a smart country. 

well... ye saale chutiye. they are in such a position to make a positive change. but, they do this bullshit. i can recall smriti iranis tenure as education minister where the only thing she did was try to make sanskrit compulsory in higher education. can't wait to see the products they come up with ! gobronomics anyone?", Meraxes373 _parmesanandstilton_ MujheHugneDo romainmyname iphone4Suser DormiN96 nura2011 Bojackartless revolution110 NGLbirder Mechgandhi,shampoo oil cancer drugs cow urine dung modi govt wants scientists work

i should have worked hard in my 11th and 12th and cleared jee, i admit. there is no good education in india outside of the iits and only handful other elite institutes. i was a bright student in primary school and had big dreams and high expectations. but something happened after 10th and it all went downhill there on.

i am a first year undergrad studying physics in a shitty university. i love physics and i hope to have a good career in the field. but going to college only demotivates me. it is a colossal waste of time. the teachers are all stupid who very likely bought their phds. they don’t even know the basics. i am forced to put up with their bullsh\*t everyday, goddammit. every lecture feels like a torture. i am an honest, sincere and a hardworking student (not bragging) and i don’t deserve what is happening to me. i don’t see how i am going to be a good physicist without a good teacher or mentor. 

i am severely depressed and have also thought and almost acted on killing myself. i got no friends and my family can’t really do anything to help me. i can’t change or quit college because 1) it’s too late now, i have already lost one year to depression and poor health 2) it is going to be the same elsewhere too and 3) it is a really bad idea to quit college in india. there is nothing around to keep me motivated. i am thoroughly fed up and feel like running away from here. i am very scared for my future. i need emotional support and i don’t know where to find it.",i hate my college and i am extremely depressed. what do i do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fko55s/i_hate_my_college_and_i_am_extremely_depressed/," r/india is basically r/depression + r/suicide + r/immigration. go see a therapist. no random stranger online can help you with your depression. i was in a similar situation and i was at iit. it might surprising but i found even those teachers to be insipid and uninspiring. teaching in colleges in india is uniformly bad with very few exceptions. 

what you can actually do is prepare your profile for applying to foreign grad schools later. try to get a good internship for your summer vacations (translation: from brand name university eg. iisc, iit) email as many professors as you can, after reading their papers (atleast abstract). sound excited. don't give up if you don't get responses immediately. don't quit college. you're in the very first year and you have your whole life ahead of you. you're frustrated because you care about your future. that's awesome, i think, because that's the first step towards changing your trajectory.

you've been dealt a starting hand. it's not as good as you wanted it to be, but believe me there are worse starting hands. 

remember those stupid quotes about attitude being more important that your aptitude? turns out there's a nugget of truth to that. now is the time to really focus on how will react to various situations around you.

accept your starting hand and focus on the things you can change, that will start getting you closer to what you want to do. if you do it right, you will find that it is hard to do but whatever the result, you will notice that your outlook will have changed, and you will get better and better at handling challenges and opportunities coming your way.

as for emotional support, lean on the people you trust and give them more than what they give you. find heroes, living or dead, who inspire you and read their words or books. if you can afford it, get professional help or counseling. it might feel like you are alone in this, but you aren't, and i believe you'll make the best out of your life!

if you want to talk more, you can pm me. ( i love physics also!) i quit engineering in final year. i wish i took the decision of quitting it earlier. trying to complete it in a not-so-good university only unnecessarily wastes your energy.

anyways, there r lots of options possible even without degree. pm me for emotional support and career advice. go see a doctor bro. your mind is playing tricks. i felt the exact same thing. after wasting my time and a shit ton of my parent's hard earned money, i realized that no matter how hard i work, india just isn't the best place to excel at in terms of sciences. i've now moved abroad and i'm in love with studies again (i never thought i'd be able to say this). the education system in india sucks for people like us.

i do suggest seeing a psychologist, but not a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, because they'll only give you medication and not proper therapy or guidance.

i worked as a psychologist that's why i know how difficult it can be.

don't quit college just yet. wait your first year out. try to study your curriculum on your own and look for classifications online. if, by the end of your first year you still feel depressed, quit your college and instead look for opportunities abroad, and especially look into scholarships, because studying abroad in expensive af.

i hope b you do well, my friend. get and make good friends and enjoy the courses if you’re truly passionate about physics, then you won’t have to worry about tomorrow. it’s not just iits and mits who are contributing to the field of science. get in touch with people in your field globally, that you admire; inspire them and be inspired. depending on your field of physics, do your own learning whenever you can and build a thesis on the subject you like.

about the substandard university situation, it’s just a degree. do your bit to pass your course. and then aim for a scholarship abroad. remember, every dark night is followed by a bright day 🙂

pm me anytime if you need a shoulder to lean on. mit ocw provides lectures for free. i was in engineering, in india. i quit in my final year. speaking from experience, it doesn't matter what uni you are in, what grade you get rn. you gotta do your work, self study works a lot. but don't just study physics, study about mental health. how to enjoy your own company, and various career paths you can find with what you're doing and how to get there. 
it's just a phase, trust me. happens to most of the students. mainly because we think we know a lot then we actually do. you'll get through this, don't worry. you can sit and talk to your parents/guardians letting them know how you're feeling is important too. don't keep everything inside.", amancalleddrake None arishsan waitinginthewings raghavaryaoutlook Android551 Daarunima benevolent001 iamthatiam81 LOVEBANANAS4EVER lightn1ng_023,hate college extremely depressed do worked hard 11th 12th cleared jee admit good education outside iits handful elite institutes bright student primary school big dreams high expectations something happened 10th went downhill on first year undergrad studying physics shitty university love physics hope good career field going college demotivates me colossal waste teachers stupid likely bought phds don t know basics forced put bullsh t everyday goddammit every lecture feels torture honest sincere hardworking student not bragging don t deserve happening me don t see going good physicist without good teacher mentor severely depressed thought almost acted killing myself got friends family can t really anything help me can t change quit college late now already lost year depression poor health 2 going elsewhere 3 really bad idea quit college nothing around keep motivated thoroughly fed feel running away here scared future need emotional support don t know find

it picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. so even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

the account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time! but it is doable. you need to setup proxy-chains on kali linux and configure it using tor's random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. you have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. i chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number! this step took a lot of time as i had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. after you have a mail id set up and ready to go, you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. i think authenticator apps can work but i do not have a spare phone which i can load a foss os on so that step is missing.

it is definitely doable, but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. this should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. i would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine, which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity! kind of a see saw in my opinion, one always goes down when the other comes up. trust and anonymity that is.

are you sure? just turn on wifi calling, it makes your calls go over your broadband connection. it's crystal clear.

provided your phone supports vowifi and your network has that service in your region. very stupid advice tbh. volte is very vital in this current environment especially for airtel and vodafone. this is why:- 

1. csfb is a very slow and resource wasteful technology. the phone needs to switch to an available 3g or 2g network whenever a call has to be made or received. 
2. both airtel and vodafone are switching off their 3g networks in phases resulting in even longer connect times when circuit switching to 2g gsm network. 
3. volte does effect your call quality. the codecs used for volte to volte transmission is of 12-14kbps which is higher than your traditional call bit rate. 
4. csfb works optimal when the legacy networks are using lower frequency than the lte network. this is now not the case as airtel and vodafone are refarming their 900mhz bandwidth for lte and shifting 2g communications to 1800mhz.

Silverballers47,2020-03-01,Science/Technology,17,37,False,"the who has sent a team of international experts to china to investigate the situation, including clifford lane, clinical director at the us national institutes of health. here is the press conference on youtube and the final report of the commission as pdf after they visited beijing, wuhan, shenzhen, guangzhou and chengdu. here are some interesting facts about covid that i have not yet read in the media:

when a cluster of several infected people occurred in china, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with covid require artificial respiration. another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). the mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in wuhan many times over. the province of hubei, whose capital is wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. a total of 40,000 employees were sent to hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in wuhan are caring for covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

china can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. the test delivers a result on the same day. across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: in guangdong province, far from wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

the vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). running nose is not a symptom of covid.

an examination of 44,672 infected people in china showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. all fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in china up to 17 february, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

healthcare system: 20% of infected people in china needed hospital treatment for weeks. china has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. the most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. china also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. thanks to this response, the fatality rate in china is now lower than a month ago.

pre-existing conditions: the fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in china was 13.2%. it was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

age: the younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

read: of those infected in china, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

gender: women catch the disease just as often as men. but only 2.8% of chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. the disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. in 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. the women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. what effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

the new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

since the end of january, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in china has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""this decline in covid-19 cases across china is real,"" the report says. the authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

one of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that china is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. there are 1,800 teams in wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. but the effort outside of wuhan is also big. in shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. in sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. in the province of guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. that means: if you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""china’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. in the face of a previously unknown virus, china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. china’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the covid-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. this rather unique and unprecedented public health response in china reversed the escalating cases in both hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain covid-19 in china. these are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""covid-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; covid-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. however, to reduce covid-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. these measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",who findings after trip to china - 5% of people who are diagnosed with covid require artificial respiration. another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. we indians are so fucked if this gets here!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbxmmt/who_findings_after_trip_to_china_5_of_people_who/," i recently read that the hospital treating these patients in wuhan had around 20 ecmo machines and many more ventilators. ecmo machines are like super advanced and super expensive. there may be less than 100 in all of india. most govt hospitals face shortage of ventilators too (which is inferior to ecmo). india cannot manage those critically ill with this disease at all. if it hits india or bangladesh the economies will take such a hit and the cost to human life will be in the tens of thousands if not millions.

i hope the concerned authorities are doing everything they can to stop it from spreading in india. i may be optimistic here, but this virus has not spread (local spread, not people who have traveled from china and europe) in warm weather countries and southern hemisphere. i don't want to jinx it, but viruses usually die, or have shorter lifespans when exposed to higher temperatures. also, clusters in southern spain and south italy (that have warmer climate at this time of the year) are smaller than near the alps, korea and china. i feel there are more cases of coronavirus in india, bangladesh, thailand, indonesia, australia and philippines than what we know but it is either spreading very slowly or not spreading due to the temperatures. i was planning a trip to himachal pradesh between march 7 and 14. does this mean that i should not? the main reason for lab testing patients with just fever is to detect the mildly infected and their contacts and isolate and quarantine them respectively thereby slowing the infection rate.

this i hear is to spread the infected over time curve’s peak over as large a time period as possible so that hospitals can handle the load of severe and critical patients without running out of resources like ventilators and doctors. if the peak is over a very short time period then severe and critical patients will flood the system leading to a high cfr not just for covid but also for other diseases whose patients will have to share the high hospital load with the covid patients.

it is like with aggressive testing and quarantining they are pausing/slowing the infection while they deal with critical cases and empty the beds for new patients.

someone repost to r/shitbjpsays

hon'ble mention:  there are millions of planets where life exists and they are regularly visiting the plant earth for educational tours: godman-on-the-run swami nithyananda not so shocking in india. its very common place.

educated people actually believe this. people who studied science believe this. 

on this very note, india has accepted many of the pseudosciences that are discarded by the rest of the world.e.g homeopathy. in the days of old, the wise speaketh and the ignorant listened. then some weasly rat bastard found that it is a money making business, since then the ignorant speaketh and the educated gullible listens fuck i can't get that picture of baba ramdev out of my head now! great ! this is how hinduism will die (or evolve).

as nonsensical stuff like this said in passing by hindu leaders comes out in public, this will make educated hindus distance themselves from their religion.

it is then just a matter of time before tide turns & many would stop beliveing in non-sensical parts of hinduism. lol, i was thinking of making a database of all this crap said by these so called godman and ministers. after opening reddit i found this article.

this made my day thanks, i will save it and show to my nri friends when they start praising modi govt. long post warning but had to share this.  i remember when i was in dubai, around a year and half ago i met a few of my friends. there was new couple who used to live in the host's building and were invited. 

so over dinner the discussion goes political. out of the 4 couple only my wife and i were leftists or in short against bjp/modi. rest were all bhakts in truest sense. seeing this i didn't push them much and was mildly debating (contrary to my nature). 

during the discussion i mentioned that a govt need not control dietary habits (beef ban) of its citizens as per religious beliefs. i also gave an example of how uae sells pork being an islamic country. india, after all is a secular democratic nation. we should strive to be better. 

then from nowhere the new woman says we need to respect cows as they are the only animals which inhale carbon-dioxide and exhale oxygen. hence we should not consume beefs and said studies are also proving this. then her husband jumps in and instead of correcting her justified saying a lot of things about the universe have yet not been proven and overtime scientists might prove this (although he knew she fucked up..but guess his marriage was more important to save). 

this was the last time we ever met the couple. they are all working expats and work for good banks etc. they also dress up smartly, consume alcohol, do parties etc etc and believe they're modern while their intellect is way worse than an illiterate. surprisingly, that jaggi vasudev comment has some truth to it. was shocked myself!

i've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
i know the fp-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
roland   fp-30 - goes for rs. 72,824 or $952.96   
roland   fp-10 - goes for rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
yamaha p-125 - goes for rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

i know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). thats why i prefer the rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

my questions  
1 - yamaha or roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like beethoven - moonlight sonata (3rd movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?

to get meta for a second, this is also how we should be organizing our societies with multiple functional concepts (health, mobility, commerce, government, etc) organized around one abstract concept (an individual) instead of each facet of an individual being siloed. an understanding of an individual is also woefully incomplete when viewed through only one lens.

shell out the money if you can and move on. second best option is to buy an after market charger. i don’t see how the service center is to be blamed for this. just take a screwdriver and try to straighten this shit out, looks doable. update if you succeed! tweeted to them, no harm in trying i guess: [https://twitter.com/adi\_pathak\_97/status/1230746286673944576](https://twitter.com/adi_pathak_97/status/1230746286673944576) i'd say that you go for the original charger. you're gonna be using it for years daily, and often under heavy loads if gaming and stuff. you don't want anything to happen to the laptop by using after market stuff. physical damage is not included in warranty and things like accessories have warranty for a lesser time (like 6 months) but that shouldn't matter since you damaged it.


the best thing i can suggest you to do is to buy a cheaper adapter then cut its wire and attach to your original one. make sure the wire is sufficiently thick though since it's a 170w adapter. 
alternatively, go to some local shops- they are the masters of jugaads. batteries and chargers are the one thing i would buy official where possible.

keyboards are the one thing i'd buy off china where possible.

iirc new generation thinkpads are using usb-c connectors for charging. go for an original replacement. will be better in the longer run. that is te connectivity part no. 1-2129334-1

that being said my fundamentals and core concepts are weak af but looking at a few articles online i do find the content pretty interesting. people who are currently working in the field, do you feel i should take the effort to learn these concepts or should i just stick to the leetcode problems and focus on landing a good job? will being good at the fundamentals have a direct impact at me being better at my job or is that something i won't ever need in my career?  i know it was definitely my responsibility to pick up these concepts in the four years that have gone by, but what should i do now?",is there any point studying cs fundamentals now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fh2w2g/is_there_any_point_studying_cs_fundamentals_now/," good fundamentals would always stand in good stead irrespective of what technology you choose. i would say start learning learn the fundamentals. use online videos like ravindrababu ravula, if you have to. it will give you a whole new perspective when you write code. https://teachyourselfcs.com/   


there are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.

both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. but type 1 engineers grow in to more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.

type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.

currently, the number of people entering the industry is rapidly increasing, while the number of cs grads is essentially static. this oversupply of type 2 engineers is starting to reduce their employment opportunities and keep them out of the industry’s more fulfilling work. whether you’re striving to become a type 1 engineer or simply looking for more job security, learning computer science is the only reliable path. i just went through a placement season and can tell you that most of the high paying companies (20lakh+ and even some 13-14 lakh) check your fundamentals thoroughly. these include your os, compilers, databases and definately algorithm. most of the times just definitions are not enough. so if you are aiming for those companies learning fundamentals is must. but at the same time don't leave practicing on leetcode because you will need to pass coding round before interview. why should do this: you may like the job in services companies which can be fulfilling depending upon which project they assign you to. or you may try to get into product companies where interview will focus on fundamentals.

if you solve leetcodce viola! you would know some basics by self learning and learning on the side will fill in missing pieces.

there are tons of content available online for cs fundamentals. and rest assured you can do the job and still learn it bit by bit.

you don't need to learn all the subjects from 4 years just a few like data structures, databases, computer architecture discrete maths; and you will see a common pattern and be more confident. e.g. check this https://github.com/pizzapokerguy/ultimate-coding-resources", seeunseenoel magenta_riddim WeakRoll _lazyninja_ light-uno,point studying cs fundamentals now currently fourth year student cs student tier 3 college im graduate less 4 months rhetoric goes education college pretty shit complacency went flow knowledge half baked and that im generous decent job offer hand less job hunting mode focus leetcode problems projects whatnot said fundamentals core concepts weak af looking articles online find content pretty interesting currently working field feel take effort learn concepts stick leetcode problems focus landing good job good fundamentals direct impact better job something ever need career know definitely responsibility pick concepts four years gone by now

i have way more expensive headphones as well (sennheiser momentum ii wireless) and still use the qcy often because of convenience and  good enough sound. i hear the realme buds are good in terms of sound quality and comfort, bose spundsport free are absolutely the best. no other set comes close. to add to the question, anyone using a pair of good earbuds *for a couple of years atleast*, whats the battery life now? i'm still waiting for pixel buds 2. i own jabra 65t. bought them on sale. love em.

sinsandtonic,2020-04-11,Politics,862,9809,False,,the wealth inequality in india is truly horrifying,https://i.redd.it/3rol63nk35s41.jpg," source? damn! these south indians always get the good things! /s this inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. like in the usa, and now india, which emulates them. 

unless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. most european countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. 

when free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. and the rich-poor gap will only increase. but if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. 

healthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. the rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. the not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. but as things stand today, here too we are copying the usa system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. 

our tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce. else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. 

but our political class does not have such a vision. so it’s all a pipe dream. the even bigger concern when we see only 3~4% of indians pay taxes. even though i assume the bottom 50% are tax exempted as their income is very less. the rest 50% should not be tax exempted. government has always sided with the rich: the reason is two-folded - one, this way the top 10% support the government which in turn causes a huge influence base and second, once the top 10% support, they are willing to shell some money to the parties as well which is also beneficial for them. solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. that way, wealth can be accurately measured. but however, there is doubt if any ruling party would take such a step as this would hugely affect their popularity and funds. [deleted] the more i look at the infographic, more puzzling it becomes. the op hasn't shown how much% of land mass he is showing with each section. instead he just labels who will own it, which does not give any info regarding the distribution of wealth. well king used to own everything before so for indians this is nothing new ! you have america’s sympathy. but not our assistance, because our government is about as useful as a paper towel in a tsunami. i earn , let’s say a very good income by indian standards and try not to pay any taxes. please hold on the pitchforks . i don’t believe that any government will do anything good with my money. there is no trust . 
what i do instead is , funnel that money into a small school that runs for tribal children and provide them quality education. my method maybe imperfect , maybe i can’t scale beyond 10 kids and maybe i end up spending more than i would have paying my it . but i am content that my rupees are bringing  real change to the community i live in.  i am too sick and tired to see a government that actually works and have given up entirely . let’s change what i can. 20 lakh +pa is 1%.

pking3,2020-02-26,Politics,4206,17837,False,"fuck all religion. fuck hindusim, fuck islam, fuck christianity, fuck buddhism. fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called religion. you know what i think about your religions? i think it is a waste of time, i think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. they all want to just believe in something good after death. sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


you are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. you do not matter. but what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


but, you are here in the now. you are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. so why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. there is no god, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. but there is this universe, where we all exist. religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the spanish flu look like a minor common cold. just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. none of your religions are without blood in your hands. all of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. and none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **false prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. we are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  what determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 a little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as modern humans in africa. we learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. we left africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °c wherein iron started to melt from the ore. with this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. we made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. these technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. and then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. in less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. the modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. but this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the stone age. 


leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. we are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. as we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the capital city delhi /r/india",fuck all religion,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/," i don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in india. so if you are born in a muslim family you'll forever be a muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. there are officially no ""atheists"" in india. we need to change this and develop the atheist culture in india. is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
then he is not omnipotent.

is he able, but not willing?
then he is malevolent.

is he both able and willing?
then whence cometh evil?

is he neither able nor willing?
then why call him god?

#pure comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~father john misty*  

the comedy of man starts like this  
our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
and so nature, she divines this alternative  
we emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
is kind enough to fill us in  
and, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
so somebody's got to go kill something while i look    after the kids    
i'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
he says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
it's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
ladies, i hope we don't end up regretting this  

comedy, now that's what i call pure comedy  
just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
they're at the center of everything  
and some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

oh, their religions are the best  
they worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
with risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
and they get terribly upset  
when you question their sacred texts  
written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
their languages just serve to confuse them  
their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
they build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
and hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
what makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
these mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
so they can go on being godless animals  

oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
their horizons that just forever recede  
and how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
that they never ever have to leave  

oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
the only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
but the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
until there's nothing human left  
just random matter suspended in the dark  
i hate to say it, but each other's all we got religion is the main cause of unrest in india. religion is one intense fandom. religion is legalised madness

edit: thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. [deleted] to all those parents and students who called moral science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. it should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. if we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. any existing religion is like superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “when you call yourself an indian or a muslim or a christian or a european, or anything else, you are being violent. do you see why it is violent? because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. when you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. so a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― jiddu krishnamurti


questioner :  kindly give a straight reply. does god exist, or not? yes, or no? if yes, how best to realize him in this life?

jk : ""if you examine very closely, you have created god. right? in india there are about – i was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (laughs) you understand? every local person has his own god.

so, sirs, we have created god. see the irony of it. thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. which is, to worship oneself and call it god. you understand all this? – the better part of you is god. right? i wonder if you understand this. first of all, let’s be clear. have you created god? the local gods round the corner, or the local god in rome, or in tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? you are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. if you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. out of your fear you want security. right? you want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. you follow? so you create that, and then worship that. just see what you are doing! going to tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? sir, look at it all. you have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. right? you have nothing else to offer. have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

if you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. but if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. you won’t go outside to look for god. you understand all this, sirs!

and the questioner wants to know if i believe in god. i don’t. because god is something created by man. there is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. right, sir? for that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. right? from your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? and we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. you are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. right? and for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. right?""", drowsy_damad CROSS_-_ ashallowheart murshiddar anirudhral vitaminberry1 None sleepygamer92 nd_lfc lemmelearnlol wrestlingfan_777,fuck religion fuck religion fuck hindusim fuck islam fuck christianity fuck buddhism fuck believing made bullshit called religion know think religions think waste think another fairytale childish adults cant grasp concept death want believe something good death sorry burst bubble thing happens blackout stop existing body decompose breakdown elements day blown universe supernova insignificant grand scheme universe matter matter itself part universe but now existing world passes universe larger anything fathom keep insisting believing man made stories god rebirth heaven hell universe exist religion brought us nothing hardship mass murder scale would make spanish flu look minor common cold take step back look past see countless lives lost religion asked so none religions without blood hands religions committed brutal acts mass murder none religions able answere basic questions life death reincarnation false prophet make believe deities religion is let go childish beliefs face truth controls destiny believe humanity faith part speck dust flying universe determines immortality religion future little speck dust flying universe legacy always betterment mankind little 300 000 years ago emerged modern humans africa learnt make tools tamed fire hunt groups mine obsidian make tools eventually farming left africa 200 000 years ago started farming domesticating animals started making clay potteries started harness power fire make pots utensils brick discovered copper using technology developed make pots brick bronze next step technological progress controlling fire 3 000 years ago iron discovered iron could extracted humans able raise temperature fire 1900 c wherein iron started melt ore came era technological leap stronger transport vehicle ships communications faster connection world via roads made using steal iron tools made great leaps terms medicine physics maths chemistry technological progress made life better extended life expectancy 30 years 60 years average 300 years ago entered industrial revolution gave us mass production luxury items everyone communications ability talk real across globe less 100 years went globe relied telephone telegraph steam ship sailboat globe video calling ability access repository human knowledge literally palm hand modern world live working together bring technology social welfare all evil thing call religion dead set taking us humans back stone age leave religion open mind loyal species nothing divides us except religion see humans place emphasis learning science become better moment religion enters humanities hard work destroyed religion evil makes followers evil extension fuck religion scourge humanity edit join r atheismindia discussion leaving faith coming back real world dear r all please take know recent religious riots happening capital city delhi r

""eat food , sleep for 6-7 hours and breath..."". 

  
what the hell people are expecting?  is people lost common sense? need speech from pm for every thing, those  humans are doing from such long time. not that i am on his side, but he did mention something on those lines. he did. kapol kalpana 1. he's been saying this only! it's called reading between the lines. when did he say go and slit the throats. he's been saying to acknowledge the gratitude towards others, and as no body is able to get out, then at least get out and gather in your respective balconies, and do small cheerful act. at least by seeing all others too in their respective balconies, it gives a sense of moral support to each one of us. it's like trapped into a void with nothing to do, and then even the simplest sight of humans around can be small little joy givers. that's the simplest of how these speeches can be decoded, psychologically. ""ghar me pade pade, bahaari duniya se naata toot chuka hai, kabhi kabaar ek dusre ko balcony me taliya bajate hi dekh lene se man ko thoda achha hi lag jata hai. aur chutiyo ki tarah taali bajane toh bola nhi hai, atleast yahi soch ke baja lo ki jo apni marwa rhe hai bichare, unko thoda thank you ya salam"". lauda har baat me fuddu point dhund ke ""sarkaar"" ki gand marne ki koi zaroorat nhi hai!  

2. government has no 9-5 job of inculcating moral values, humanitarian values and sense of gratitude & belonging into people. it's the job of your parents see your upbringing. even if government says hindus go and slit muslims, aren't you a human being? haven't you got the basic sense of understanding what's called a life? haven't you been taught from your parents that we all come from same blood and flesh? and we are all mortals? ab kya gandhi ya modi sarkar pehle banaye, fir tumhe sikhae ki jeevan me kya krna chahiye ya kya nahi? aur jab sarkar tumhe batayegi ki jeevan me kya krna kya nahi karna, fir hi jake hum kuch karengey. nahi toh nahi. toh bhai sarkar nahi, tum chutiya ho, aur tumhari parvarish me kami hai. chahe gandhi baithey, tharoor kal ko baithe ya modi ya shah, har baar, har fuudu baat par ""sarkaar"" ko bich me lana, aur bolna, ki sarkar bataegi toh karenge ji .. nahi toh nhi. aur sarkar nhi bataegi, to sarkar chutiya. aur sarkar ne kuch bataya, toh usme galti nikal kr bolo, sarkar gandu. tumhari samajh, education aur moral values ghaass charne gai hai?  

3. khud socho aur khud karo jo theek lagta hai. lastly, if i make you a shepard, and give you 100 goats and ask you to take them to grazing, you'll go well, make sure they are fed well, and you'll bring them back safe. after some time i give you 1000 goats, and ask to fed them by taking them to graze. but 500 of them love dried grass, 500 love wet. as a shepard, you'll still try to make sure each one happy by providing different types of grass as per their need. but then after some time i give you 1 lac goats, and ask to make sure each one's need is satisfied, then you'll run away. you just cant handle the fucking quantity. india is that group of goats now. 1.4 billion. the bloody population with each having their own demands. and then blaming one man, or government, is absolute stupidity. we ourselves are to blame, for what we've made this nation into.

 > during this 9-minute lights out initiative, about 10,000-12,000 mw of power demand is expected to vanish, according to estimates by power industry experts. so posoco needs to ramp down electricity supply accordingly during this time block and ramp up again once this 9-minute period is over and the baseload demand returns in full strength. any missteps in handling this could possibly lead to a high voltage surge, tripping the lines, causing damage to the national grid and an extended power outage.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tv_pickup

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sldavewwfra


""tv pickup is a term used in the united kingdom to refer to a phenomenon that affects electricity generation and transmission networks. it often occurs when a large number of people watch the same tv programmes while taking advantage of breaks in programming to use toilets and operate electrical appliances, thus causing large synchronised surges in national electricity consumption. electricity networks devote considerable resources to predicting and providing electricity supply for these events, which in the uk, for example, typically impose an extra demand of around 200–400 megawatts (mw) on the national grid. short-term supply is often obtained from pumped storage reservoirs, which can be quickly brought online, backed up by the slower fossil fuel and nuclear power stations. the largest ever pickup was on 4 july 1990, when a 2800 mw demand was imposed by the ending of the penalty shootout in the england v west germany fifa world cup semi-final.[1][2] in addition to pickups, the grid also prepares for synchronised switch-offs during remembrance and energy-awareness events."" eli5 why would grid fail if all the electricity is shut off?", 42err india_ko_vanakkam wewillalldiesomeday narki-kameena indi_n0rd Dead-Shot1 Dialup1991 pgidoc miew09 insanegenius iphone4Suser,lights switched might lead failure grid emergency services fail might take week restore power would appeal public light candles lamps without switching lights nitin raut maharashtra energy minister

scam artist there is no ventilator in ludhiana in a government setup. the civil hospital has ventilators but no intensvist to operate them. recently the civil hospital authorities moved those ventilators to a nearby medical college and asked them to operate those ventilators in a covid ward. 

source: work in healthcare in ludhiana at this rate, if you cook maggi for 3 minutes, you will be booked for sedition. the article does not list the actual number of ventilators in ludhiana.

if the poster is factually correct, then the ""whistle blower"" needs to be protected.

if he was doing this just to make money (for his ngo), then some criminal case is justified. sedition

sure some tablighi jamat members were fools and anger against that small number is justified but demonising whole community, esp. large section of indian muslims, who has nothing to do with this, for mistake of handful of jamaatees is simply sinister  and malicious. when yogi's hindutva militia has to fact check hindutva propaganda, you know shit's really hit the fan. why doesnt police takes action against these news outlets, like fir or something, instead of doing a keyboard war?

like this is legitimate fake news, they are basically committing crime, and at most police is doing is reply to their tweets? if it was some poor guy out to buy medicine, he would have been lynched by police without hearing him out poor guys . get virus. and being accused of getting it deliberately. on a human level i feel so sorry for their plight. cannot blame them for being devoted followers as that isnt frowned upon in society.

uff! that was ball busting. [deleted] my speculations.

there wont be a lockdown but there will be a ban on inter city travel of people till end of this month, i guess (goods can still move). this is enough to test the impact of community spread and if the measures are effective.

apart from intercity travel, there would be closing of certain infra services which is already being announced.

modi could announce a relief package. like suspension of debt for a month like what france did but that is too far fetched idea for now. lot of misinformation/fake messages/gharelu nuskhey being spread over whatsapp groups

received one just now in my family group saying govt will spray medicine against coronovirus using choppers so stay inside, dont have your clothes hanging outside and don't panic if you hear loads of helicopters flying over how can i convince my father to stay home and not go to office? he somehow thinks it is  absolutely imperative for him to go to office and says he takes all precautions but at his age it makes no sense to go everyday. thing is that i am not in the same city currently so it is very difficult just to convince him over phone. i declare bankruptcy i like it - do a test, get feedback, maybe repeat later.

it's better they leave india for their own good cuz we don't seem seem to be capable of rising above such petty remarks and way of thinking. why is the flair coronavirus? all asian countries are racist as fuck but among them the   worst are indians, chinese, koreans and israelis for practising racial hatred against their own countrymen. nationalism mei bhi number 1

""india definitely has capacity to cater to both global and local markets"" b-but... we have meds... we literally lifted restrictions... why does it show empty plates? india produces about 70% of chloroquine, and then suddenly banning will create a havok in these times. instead of this we can just ramp up production and sell them to needed countries. told my bhakt neighbour this, he said daro mat beta trump kya kar lega, nuclear hai hamare pass. modi ji chup nahi bethege. so no one here understands how supply chain works? even when we banned exports we still lose money because of contracts. it’s still your money. and of course being the market leader, the us has some leverage that they will use. being a liberal these days just means acting cool on reddit and not have a iota of understanding how things work in reality. this isn’t progressive by any means! 

everyone here is addicted to name calling, virtue signaling. every time we name call the other , we are only widening the divide. stop with holier than tho attitude please! from being a rational sub, we are turning this into an hateful and a myopic echo chamber is it modi and indian government's fault if trump is being an asshole ?

if the government doesn't lifts the ban and we have to face sanctions as a result they'll still get blamed. this cartoon lacks both taste and common sense. you guys amaze me sometimes . wow, what happened to that trade deal when he came to india and said chihuahua instead of chaiwalla? you are fake news donald trump may be convinced that banging plates for 9 minutes at 9 pm can may cure corona.

ps: not a congress supporter, just my observation. to survive in politics one need to be ruthless. rahul is lacking that. that is a flaw with the existing political set up. but unfortunately political commentators are considering that as a negative trait. because most of them expect a leader to be a dictatorial monarch.

neither law provides for adequate due process to a detainee to defend their constitutionally enshrined rights. this is just sad more than enraging. democracy really *does* die in darkness. why on earth is **this** being downvoted?

i'm sorry, but if you honestly believe that the government should have the power to declare anyone a ""terrorist"" and keep him behind bars for years without trial or evidence, fuck you. 

anand might never come out of prison. for a crime he never committed. for a crime that never even took place. this is so god damn infuriating. this is beyond shamelessness that is out on display. bjp/rss is just itching for the social fabric to be as frayed as possible so that they can swoop in with another socially polarizing issue.

there is no real threat to india other than this political party/ideology. this is the true anti-national threat our country faces. wake the fuck up and smell the coffee people. we are in the midst of two pandemics. a viral and a social. remember. bjp hates dalit rights activists. because dalit votes comes cheap and in massive numbers. i did some quick search and found out that the crime he committed was comparing modi to hitler.

is there more to this story? >“mayavi” in the hindu mythology refers to a demon meant to be destroyed. when i was illegally arrested by the pune police while still under the protection of the supreme court, a cyber-gang of the hindutva brigade vandalised my wikipedia page. this page is a public page and for years i was not even aware of it.

>they first deleted all information and only wrote, “he has a maoist brother…his house was raided…he was arrested for links with maoists,” etc. some students later told me that whenever they tried restoring the page, or editing the page, this gang would pounce upon it and delete everything and put derogatory content.

the first thing minions does in every case, doesn't matter if its person or organisation or state. i remember a petty tampering incident: they tampered utharakhand flood news removing kerala's contribution from it to push the narrative that one shouldn't help dying people during then ongoing kerala floods. in democracies, there will be always laws like uapa that allow people to be arrested without conclusive proof and proper justice. other laws like the ""sedition law"" are vague and often contrarian to the ""freedom of speech"" right. even congress(i) has been guilty of misuse of such draconian laws. till such laws are in place, government/politicians will work to use it to silence people they don't like.

the people should fightback against them, especially the literate amongst us. any unkill or boomer would know about pota and tada and how people were often unjustly convicted and jailed. this has been going on for long. 1980s had a lot of tada based arrests.

traditional media has always been mouthpieces of the government. beware of the government. what can we do to help him? commenting for visibility!

p.s. upvote the post please, it will be downvoted by saghis. > i was disturbed by these intrusions but comforted myself that it might rather convince the police that i was a ‘normal’ person and that there is no element of illegality in my conduct.

johnruby,2020-04-08,Politics,116,564,False,,china’s blunders in wuhan should settle the debate about democracy and economic progress: the virus exploded from wuhan to the world because the chinese form of government abhors transparency. what they need is democracy — and india should learn this lesson.,https://theprint.in/opinion/china-blunders-wuhan-should-settle-debate-democracy-economy/397968/," authoritarianism never works. whether it is with our own children or with the economy, it always messes things up in the long run. it's sad that our supreme leader wants to bring the same level of censorship and outright authoritarianism that china has, but without the economic growth. the worse part is that if you ask an average middle class modi supporter  indian about this, they're quite happy with their guy subverting democratic institutions in our country. well, as a democracy, the us completely screwed up the response, including 

1. a president that took no action for 2months despite grave warnings
2. a federal government that  actively prevents states from getting the support they need
3. senators selling their stocks using insider information while telling the public that everything is fine
4. hospitals (they're for profit) operating at such a lean (cost avoidance) level, that they can't sustain even modest increases in patients, let alone a pandemic
5. people going bankrupt due to health care costs and job loss

so while i do not like the chinese dictatorship, we shouldn't pretend that a capitalist democracy is some magic way of proper government. my hope is that india learns from both countries and comes out of this stronger and wiser as a nation. this pandemic has brought about a lot of ill-will for china. i think india should use this as an opportunity to present itself as an alternative to china as far as manufacturing is concerned. i am pretty sure that a lot of corporations would be looking at supply chain alternatives in case similar events happen in the future. india should strike while the iron is hot the wet markets in china are in fact legal, not illegal like it is stated in the article. they were made legal in the 80s to combat lack of food, but it has become a luxury now.  china is now making a decision to change those laws. china doesn't care. 
stop buying that oppo or or xiaomi phone, that mg hector suv, and then maybe they will. there a nations with democracy, who had sufficient warnings & still managed to mess up.

sure you may blame china to react how most nations would behave when faced with a sudden crisis. but you gotta hand it to them for bringing it to control (within their borders) so fast. china will always be the elephant in the room for india.

two massive populations next door to each other will always mean a head on collision into the near future. that's not the reason the virus spread to the rest of the world though. it's a highly contagious disease. it spread really fast before anyone could figure out how serious it was. even if they'd been transparent, they'd have slowed it down at best.

sure, that may have saved lives, and for that you can blame china and several other countries for not taking it seriously. but we couldn't have totally stopped it. problem is people of india think too highly of their flawed democracy.
praising india's democracy is just another way of justifying cruelty of bjp government at center.
silent majority of poor people in india suffers every day and people who praise this democracy are big reason for their suffering. if this pandemic started in india it would've been a lot worse due to india having less capacity for pcr testing than china, as well as less of a capacity for lockdowns and contact tracing. there were 50k cases in wuhan alone officially and possibly up to 500k if you don't believe chinese numbers. how many would there have been in mumbai if it started there? while authoritarian china did make mistakes, let us not forget that many democratic governments dealt with the crisis even worse than china. 

yes, things could have been better if there was more transparency and freer press on china. but we supposedly have all those things in italy, in uk, in the us, and yet their governments were refusing to react even after it became clear that there was going to be a pandemic. there had been enough information coming out of china by mid january for the rest of the world to act. yet, they didn't. why?

china is an easy target, but blaming only them deflects from the most fundamental reason for the failure to stop this pandemic.

the world failed to stop the virus because  of the blind race towards economic growth that we are so beholden to in our capitalist societies. the world was to afraid to to take steps that would cut the profits of large companies until it had no other choice left. that is why we failed to stop this pandemic. not only because of china.", rehnedeyaar PoppaB13 SoftwareCoolie KingOfSuns None DrMrJekyll khilarichowkidar aperture_synce jhon-dav None the_S1lence,china blunders wuhan settle debate democracy economic progress virus exploded wuhan world chinese form abhors transparency need democracy learn lesson

>a man dressed in **civilian clothing** came to their residence and served a notice to vardarjan. he **refused to give his name** but said that he was sent by the ayodhya “prashasan”. sundar said that later in the afternoon, seven or eight uniformed officers came knocking at their door in a **black suv with no number plate.**

mind that the whole argument was about wire saying that yogi said :*'lord ram would protect devotees from the coronavirus'*. now the wire have no proof of this and thus they removed this line long before anything.

but,

on the other hand, we should not forget that yogi was doing the [raam navmi event](https://thewire.in/politics/coronavirus-yogi-adityanath-lockdown-ram-navami-ayodhya) after the lockdown, not only that but they were also planning to do [*raam navmi mela*](https://theprint.in/india/governance/despite-coronavirus-lakhs-to-gather-in-ayodhya-because-this-ram-navami-is-different/381972/)  despite coronavirus threat. so i doubt the wire is lying. priorities during a global crisis. what is the context of the word 'unannounced' here? does indian police usually inform before paying a visit? does police need to give a notice before showing up to give a notice? [removed] does the police call or book an appointment in advance, in other places?

it is highly unlikely that the doctors so blatantly refuse to treat someone based on religion. we are not on that level yet. i'm mad at this guy, but i'm even more mad at journalists who blatantly lied few days ago even without doing basic investigation. why? because they saw potential  hindu-muslim angle, one of the most inflammatory topic in this country right now. 

the man is not very educated but these journalists sure are. and that minister who made a video without solid details of the case- he should publically apologize and resign.

doctor's name was revealed in all the articles as well, those journalists almost sabotaged his career. that doctor should file defamation suit against those journalists and news channels.

members of this sub are no better, most of them jumped to conclusion even though there was not enough details in any of those articles. some people are justifying his act here saying he is not mentally stable or he is uneducated. some are saying that he is not muslim because real muslim can't lie. this is the exact reason why rw is able to create mass hatred among hindus towards muslim.

we need to criticize every bad deed irrespective of religion. you can't get away just because you are minority or uneducated or you claim that you are not mentally stable.

also media is also wrong here by playing on the communal lines. but media has been like this for ever. this is not something new. now we have a responsibility to criticize every person who is doing something wrong irrespective of his religion. he should be jailed. in an already complicated world and a complicated year, people are creating more confusion. amazing. jail the fucker. shame on him, this guy should be jailed. at the time when people need to trust doctors the most this man is spreading lies, he should be punished for this, so that it doesnt happen again. those who believe it were stupid. i never did. are you guys dumb?", TereDoDoBaap Bapu_Ji None ravindra_jadeja Upset_Text ThanosMadeSense wildcardbitchesday morning17 TendarCoconut juancorleone apple_pie_nlue_pie,muslim man claimed pregnant wife turned away rajasthan hospital says lied

p.s. - if your pet is able to stay under house arrest, or any criminal for that matter, you can do this too. go for it! forced optimism is as dangerous as being pessimist. and i am truly more on the paranoid side of things here.

however one thing that people may be under estimating, is the power of social media.

recently in a discussion, one of the positions we arrived at was that it doesn’t matter how good modi is, it all pales in comparison to the social media messaging . pt. 2?
someone got. link to part 1? probably the work of his pr agency. every world leader has such agencies who program each and every action as if the person were a robot. i think mr.modi was very outspoken before he became pm. now  he feels like a robot. planned speeches with zero direct interaction and with hidden agendas. that's well deconstructed. i wish this could be explained in the many indian languages and sent to everyone. everyone needs to read this to understand the pied piper they are following like rats. this was honestly the best kind of criticism anyone can give. you win. ""you get invested"" 

""now any criticism of government becomes your criticism""

now i get why bhakts are way they are!!

these are same people who chewed out upa - 2 for even breathing (rightfully so)

but they won't listen a slightest complain about modi sarkar, resort to name calling like pakistani or liberandu yea, this begins from when a politician asks for your vote. and is the hallmark of all successful politicians.

""ask not what your country can do for you..."" sorta reminds of stockholm syndrome. the citizens have developed a psychological alliance through this methodology, despite their sufferings.  
say what you want about the govt., they understand human nature and are master manipulators. the very basic requirement for becoming a great leader. this is amazing. i always felt it and never was able to describe it as nicely as you did. great job.

his charisma and command over people has me worried that this could be turned into a dictatorship really soon. we are one disaster away to be going towards that direction, even covid-19 could be the disaster that leads to it. 

we as a country need to go against the bullshit the government, no matter who’s government is in power. people should question the government rather than doing the baseless tasks like sheep.

i dissent on ""gandhi couldn't have done it"" quip.

gandhiji led people to walk after him, to burn their expensive factory made clothes, to fill the jails, to die but not to pick weapon. 

gandhiji was magnanimously welcomed in britain by the mill workers who were at loss due to his swadeshi movement. 

[when mahatma gandhi was welcomed by textile mill workers of lancashire ](https://indianexpress.com/article/research/when-gandhi-was-welcomed-by-textile-mill-workers-of-lancashire-england-in-1931-4869860/lite/)

and all of this while setting such high moral benchmarks. all of this while there was no electronic media as we see today. 

you couldn't compare this charismatic dimwit (or any other leader for that matter) with gandhiji. there's no comparison there. we're wired to follow, not question. it's a habit instilled from our school days. i was reading baudrillard's america yesterday, and his description of reagan applies to modi too  
>and it works. with this smile reagan obtains a much wider consensus thanany that could be achieved by a kennedy with mere reason or politicalintelligence. the recourse to a pure form of compliment, be it animal orinfantile, is much more successful and the whole american populationcomes together in this toothpaste effect. no idea - not even the nation’smoral values in their entirety - could ever have produced such a result.reagan’s credibility is exactly equal to his transparency and the nullity of hissmile. there is no charming of idiots. they will follow a clown no matter what as long as he spews their kind of filth it's not charm. he says things people want to hear. people are scared, in panic and are surprisingly hindu nationalists. he gives them things which make them feel safer while playing along with religion. charm nahi, shitty politics hai yeh. >we would have benefited if he told us to do something which was worth it

now the reason he wanted to do all of this was to make us feel united and all like that. i can agree that some people may not agree with this being a logical and a beneficial step. according to me i don't care, because whether we clap for doctors or light candles in our balcony and stay united, it still boils down to staying isolated and maintaining hygiene.

just wanted to ask, what could have been some nice steps taken by him which would be worth it in your opinion?

edit- thanks for the downvotes woke people! i appreciate you all! in a country where people literally erect temples in honour of cricketers and film stars, are you really surprised that a man who knows how to sweet talk his way into anything has a cult of personality? celebrity worship is a part of our culture at this point. i think peer pressure and societal pressure is very big in india too. there are people who did the lighting thing as well even though they disagree with modi in every single aspect. this is because they don't want to be referred to as gaddars. unfortunately in india modi bhakti equates to loving the nation. of course he has. connect and reverence among junta is unparalleled unlike any indian leader i have seen in my life, maybe vajpayee. modiji indirectly showed why his govt is likely to slash a part of the education budget. it's more to do with cheap and easy access to internet and the social media. bjp mastered using social media to further its agenda long before other parties even realised its potential. couple that with the fact that a lot of people lack critical thinking and would easily believe the propaganda they've been fed, it's not surprising. unfortunately, even most of the indian media has just become an echo chamber for govt propaganda making it easy to believe whatever bullshit is being fed to the masses.

modi is not unique, he is just one more of the growing number of assholes using the same playbook..look at bolsanaro, erdogan, orban, trump etc. at least in america, the press has much more freedom and individuals can openly criticise the president hence things are not as bad as in some of the other countries.", The_Almighty_Bob Suraj1511 adchait bluepensioner Shriramrishi DravitGupta Brokenteethequalcaps rehnedeyaar psy_think Candid-Advance cantthinkofauname,matter much hate modi can t deny guy unbelievable charm knows command shit show janta curfew was didn t expect lot light candles tonight right see following ringmaster said again don t think making right anyone could that dr manmohan singh couldn t that vajpayee couldn t that gandhi couldn t done would benefited told us something worth still keen running clown show despite seriousness issue hand charisma command worried could turned dictatorship really soon disaster away going towards direction covid 19 could disaster leads country need go bullshit matter who power question rather baseless tasks sheep end rant

in my hospital, we don't accept *any* patient in labour who did not have check ups and follow up with us. we've had very bad legal experiences.

edit: downvoting is okay, but i'd actually like to hear your views on why do you think that the media should be blamed. except incase of our people, nothing is flushed and drained out. all is accumulated in their tiny empty brain. [deleted] taking buttface to a whole new level this is the increasingly the case everywhere. the problem is inherent in human psychology. if anyone takes a bit of trouble of reading up on behavioural economics (thinking, fast and slow by kanheman is a great start), you'll know that humans are anything but rational. people, even after getting phd's get easily manipulated by framing effects, priming, anchoring. it is also a fact that the more you repeat propaganda the more the public believes something. all these, along with the fact that the information age has given people an access to too much information which they again can never take the time of verifying leaves a lot of room for manipulation. 

also the simple fact is if you're driven by money, the easiest thing is to pertain to these bugs in human thinking. add dramatic background music and yell and try and stir up a conflict between religious, political groups and people will tune in. the whole dynamics of the media will be against you if you're trying to do 'real journalism'. i could go on but no one will read this anyway perhaps.

all they do is add a question mark after each fake news they want to peddle and then get away with it.

they went after ""corona jihad"" with full force. called them terrorists and what not.

how the hell they can get away with all that? terrorism is a word that means something. jihad too means something. they just can't say these words. how is all this not a literal fake news as well?  essentially what they said is that there is a big conspiracy by muslims to use the virus to kill millions in the name of jihad...and we are just gonna let them go, or not ask a single question from security agencies who are supposed to keep us safe from acts of terrorism. the whole nation is like, ""oh, i see, jihad and terrorism. ugh, muslims bad,"" and then they go to sleep well at night after watching ramayan?

how the fuck is army not deployed to deal with this act of terrorism in a country of 200 million muslims? if they are not, how the fuck is that the channel's owners and executives not behind bars? it's not mistake if it keeps repeating.. i am assuming they didn't apologise on the same ""prime time"" in which they showed the fake newsa.

it's also important to note that the situation in kashmir loc is nothing like anywhere else in the world. no country literally pushes terrorists in through a border across the world unless those crossing the border are outside state control (eg. al shadab of nigeria). state sponsored terrorism is super rare.

you can hate modi / bjp but when terrorist enter india from its northwest borders, they kill hindus and muslims alike. after all, a kashmiri religious head [was killed](https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/sunday-special/who-killed-mirwaiz/) by these men in 1990 for trying to bring peace in the valley through dialogue with indian authorities. so this is some serious shit. bhen ke takke pakistanis for people questioning how is it possible for these terrorists to sneak in? 

> movement is greatly restricted and the loc fence, which is the anti-infiltration obstacle system, lies buried deep under ice during this season. this is the most opportune time for infiltration attempts as another month from now efforts by the indian army's corps of engineers to refurbish the anti-infiltration obstacle system would be underway on a war footing just like they have been each year for the last 15 years; an earlier effort to refurbish is not possible due to the presence of ice and snow.

india needs a national registry and get tough on enforcing it's borders, or just decimate itself into million pieces. there are a bunch of people around it who do not merely like it's existence ultimately. that explains why they can't resume 3g services even now there. it really doesn't. as expected, pak will find a lot of support among separatists in kashmir after the manner in which article 370 was diluted. use a lot of drones for monitoring. nothing new. we don't hear when there's already successful infiltration, because it's not very uncommon. so i don't know if ""*pakistan groups trying*"" is a big news.

nevertheless, it's a matter of security agencies. no public opinion needed. but when 'intelligence' is given to media, it's always for politics and to spin it every which way they want. why is that whenever people question the govt. on economic failings.. we start hearing pakistan-border-infiltration-terrorist etc?

is this a way to distract people from real issues? bet there'd be heaps of newly minted separatists to join them after how much the region has been antagonized. it seems we'd never learn wont deal with this properly,will gloss over our soldiers dying unless for political mileage and then use incident as excuse to target own citizens who are minorities. current goi is predictable.", Sulh-i-kul WPHero duckduckfuckfuck stringsandknots dogaa TendarCoconut salabhsg cold-flame swamyrara anor_wondo Buns4Funz,pakistan groups trying send 200 terrorists around 160 terrorists lashkar e taiba let jaish e mohammed jem hizbul mujahideen hm ready infiltrate valley according intelligence inputs available national security planners

i think we are all forgetting how fast things have changed. i still had classes at my college on march 14. my classes weren't suspended until two days later. a lot of people did not think (wrongly, of course) that this was going to be this much an issue. and an important reason for that was that both the government and the media weren't really taking it that much seriously at that time either. you can't expect all these people to have known what was coming. it was the police and local governement's responsibility to ensure that something like this did not happen, they failed. i understood the reason why this government kept denying community transmission till now, even when multiple cases came forward, where it was 100% clear of community transmission.

they waited for this moment, in which, this nijamudin thing blow up. now they can blatantly blame muslims who attended this gathering for spreading corona throughout the country; they have even lodged firs to highlight it. same thing happened in mh, where a fir is lodged on saudi family by shiv sena leader for breaking quarantine but not on other people who broke the same.

we all are middle class income group.","why do indians feel so appreciative of their government, no matter the hardship?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqdm0y/why_do_indians_feel_so_appreciative_of_their/," expectations from the government is so abysmally low that even the basic duty of the government is met with a lot of appreciation. indians think of the government as their parent. 

it should be respected and its authority is unquestioned. it should also provide you with everything you need.

this is why you get this weird amalgamation of talking about respecting the govt, etc and at the same time, expecting the govt to take care of all problems in society. because this government wasn't elected for governance, it was elected on sectarian lines. a lot of people are invested in this government because they view it as an extension of their own sectarian identities. caste and religion nothing else matters....they could  keep fucking them left and right and they will gladly take it because of their bigotry and hatred for other communities so appreciative that police can beat you down to death for purchasing essentials. 
the media and other so called celebrities, who laud police for their brutality, government which gives free arms to police for beating it's own citizens. this is a dystopian society we are living in. this country is fucked beyond recovery. 

all that matters to the citizens is their caste and religion. majority of the population still look at people from other religion as ""they"" and not us. we are divided by every means possible. even the most microscopic effort from the current "" banana republic"" is touted as the best we could ever get. today a man in my town was beaten so brutally that he suffered a serious head injury, his fault, he came to buy meat from the local market.

indians in a nutshell are racist,sexist, casteist and self appreciative. we are very good story tellers. still reminiscing the days of glory and failing to acknowledge the grim reality of the present. nor working towards a better future, we have failed on every level as a country. it's not that indians are appreciative of the government, they are just blind  towards their own failings and misery. my friend asked me and i quote:
"" yah, indian healthcare system is bad; but it's your problem. what can modi do about it!?"".

r.i.p folks we have been doctrined to respect authority. we still don't know how to stand on our own and look towards the authority for guidance. this leads to what you questioned. because hindu khatre mein hai. the indian privileged class were so threatened by a 5% erosion of their privilege in 60 years that they will tolerate any level of hardships just as long as the others have it worse. because education means shit. religious chauvinism and bullshit taught by elders take precedence. they will bend over backwards to get beaten up even more and not realize it till they die. saddest thing is our poor doesn't even asked government to do something for them. they just accepted the lockdown and started to walk to home, whatever the distance.

i feel this is our biggest failure that our poor doesn't even ask anyone for help. a large number of people are speaking out in favour of police brutality, military control and govt surveillance in a way i've never seen before. we have gone from a nation that held a healthy level of skepticism regarding govt policy to blind govt worship.", gamma_professor fools_eye knowtoomuchtobehappy bootylover81 KS_0789 The_andh_bhakth bmkjay plowman_digearth Profitlocking Mudi-kaka mmousey,indians feel appreciative matter hardship angry discussion sister can t believe wants give free pass crisis story everyone know middle class income group

>“chinese  companies working on existing projects in india, with sufficient supply  networks in place, can take over the construction of makeshift  hospitals like those in wuhan upon india's invitation,"" the global times  quoted a china railway construction corporation (crcc) limited official  as saying. china is not a single person, fucking fucks.
 
if they offer sincere help, we take it. we need all the help look it as humans helping humans. coronavirus yeh nahi dekhega ki tum hindu ho ya muslim, kannada ho ya punjabi. we donated masks to italy. maybe some african nation would need us in the future china has a lot to gain from this. it's in china's best interest to see the global economy do well so that they can churn out their products to the world as they have always done. and india is a big market for them just like every other country. 

so, it wouldn't be wrong to assume that they don't have any bad intentions behind this. india should take them up on their offer. it needs all the help it can get when shit eventually hits the fan.

let's hold them accountable after the pandemic ends. everyone who is pissed off about india not opening arms to this ""assistance"" from china, its not simple as that. china never takes any action without an obfuscated motive or manipulation and political influence.

please look at the actions of president xi and where they have sent funds until now. also at jack ma's donations. every county where china has diplomatic relationship/investments got big donations from jack ma. many countries in afrika and asia, ofcourse except india. this money is coming from ccp via jack ma cause ccp cannot send funds to so many countries in asia and ignore india. it will raise lot of questions on their actions. but one individual can, no one can ask ma ""why not india?"" cause its 'his money, his wish'. 

on the other hand china is now offering money/assistance directly to india so that they can twist india's arm later when they see it convenient or necessary. read carefully, it is not a donation. that is how they have influenced their way to the top of unsc and built so many ports surrounding india in the indian ocean. and it is not good for india to fall into china's trap. specially india. we are the only ones that stand against it in asia, defending tibet, bhutan, nepal etc.
if you remember this is similar to uae offering assistance for keral floods.

india should rather go with g20's fund allocations and look at allies.

about me, i am a big critic of modi and all the shit he does on a daily basis with my friends, family, over the internet. if the fucker hadn't wasted money on statue of unity we probably would have been in better situation right now. but don't let that cloud your judgement here. it's a deep, insidious move from china.

ps: chinese people are not ccp, ccp is not xi. keep that in mind and don't be racist to chinese peope. but when it comes to governence, diplomacy, yes china is one man. it is an autocracy. it's just theatricality nothing more. [deleted] china is on a major pr exercise after having hidden the real statistics about the virus. 

it's a bit like my neighbor who sent his kids out to play with mine even though he knew they were infected. and now he's offering his family doctor to me. i mean, ok, i'll take it but i ll never forget. everyone in the replies is fucked. china is trying to help and yall are busy being uninformed racists issa trap no thanks

india_ko_vanakkam,2020-03-23,Politics,160,1005,False,"on 20th march, 18 firms got permission from govt. to get their testing kits validated by national institute of virology.

meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, gujarat-based firm cosara had already received an approval to start manufacturing covid-19 test kits. this firm is a collaboration between a us-based company & an ahmedabad-based firm.

cosara's kits already have us fda approval.

some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

cosara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their covid-19 kits.

suddenly, on 21st march, the health ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct covid-19 tests. the cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

these guidelines have one caveat - only testing kits approved by us fda/european ce can be used.

that means only kits manufactured by ahmedabad-based cosara can be used for covid-19 testing.

so after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor only 1 ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

why is a gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines? 

i've (saket gokhale) filed an rti to get more info.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-test-kits-may-be-non-starter/articleshow/74765890.cms?from=mdr

update: now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that us fda and eu ce approval aren't mandatory. so, now roche and cosara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. but the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

update from saket gokhale. https://twitter.com/saketgokhale/status/1242076189205749761/photo/1","there's something very fishy going on with covid-19 testing kits in india. prima facie, it reeks of corruption & favoritism in a pandemic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnfnh1/theres_something_very_fishy_going_on_with_covid19/," the ministry issued a clarification today that test kits validated by the indian agencies will be allowed. just saw press conference from health ministry - they are saying that they have approved two companies and will approve more companies as soon as possible. who owns that company and how much electoral bond did they buy? > chaos is a ladder. is it just me or the thread is blowing it out of proportion? those kits by the gujrat company are us-fda approved while rest are not. also the guidelines can be changed anytime. in the time of crisis why not go with the already tested kits if anyone thinks that this government is not corrupt, then you are an idiot.

i know for a fact that the promoter of siyaram silk mills paid an actual 50cr bribe to amit shah after his company was embroiled in a customs duty evasion scam.

basically they were importing material from china and mislabelling it to reduce their liabilities. they got caught and with the material seizure and penalties the damage would have been 100cr.

a 50cr bribe being paid out led to the entire incident getting brushed under the carpet.

i am not revealing my sources because if i do then that person will get in trouble. them having us fda approval eliminates the need for india to to run its own quality control, validation, etc and go through that whole process.

when time is of the essence, i don't see why this measure is unreasonable.

you can question the price cap, but this is only for private testing regardless. those who can afford it, can go for it. the government will test the rest. correct? >why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines?

privatization and tender to favorable companies, duniya marey ya jeeye we don't give a fuck: the motto of the current government

just because a hindu won't face them and ask them the right questions they manipulate them to face towards the muslims, i hope everyone ""of them"" is enjoying the anal now. this has been happening for a very long time with almost every major firm, these fuckers don't care about anyone.

""it's pure business"" few doubts here 

a.) ""modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines"" : what was the previous guideline issued is it recorded anywhere, because if it isn't present then there was no change. i am assuming the change is only usfda /ce approved

b.) is it a difficult process for other 18 to get usfda /ce approval? do you need a parent company or a jv with an american company for it?


c.) is there any link to the present guidelines issued where we can read it? your post is outdated, factually incorrect, misleading and should be taken down.

there is a big difference between the cost of the test kits: 400-500 per kit as you say, and the cost of testing: 4.5 k.
because those two aren't the same.

how foolish do you think people are? the kits that are being manufactured will be sold at a different price and the testing, done private labs like dr. lal, will be done at a different/higher rate because the two are not the same. there's a supply chain going on here. i used to share your posts on ig, and that's going to stop today. what bullshit propaganda is this? the left is know for many things, but the one thing it can always fall back on is its integrity. and you, have violated that today.

so you see, even us bengalis in india are being told such things. you are perfectly safe in most parts of india, so don't worry. tell him to fuck off. all y'all are welcome here!

also say if we didn't like bangladeshi people, the 1971 war would have been an entirely different result. just look at his name. he's just a jobless and dumb fuck messing with you.

honestly. just go to r/publicfreakout and you'll see dozens of videos of policemen beating the life out of people who disobey the lockdown.

now, i understand that the victims in said videos are undoubtedly foolish for not following lockdown, but you can see that the cops in the videos cannot wait to just beat the hello out of the citizens. have we forgotten that we live in a cultured civilisation?

this leads mento the opinion that there must be more rigorous background checking when taking in police officers into the force. corrupt officers in india are not common, and it's a shame that that the general populus is alright with that. please, we need to have stricter criteria for accepting police officers onto the workforce.",indian cops are uncontrollable animals with pent-up rage waiting to unleash it on civilians.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fomt9e/indian_cops_are_uncontrollable_animals_with/," these kind of cops remind me of strict indian dads who go berserk and beat their own children for making minor mistakes. they try to release all their pent up stress and anger accumulated from their office on their poor children. they are harassing and beating delivery boys of zomato as well. indian police force needs better training imo, like training in how to treat people,when not beat the shit out of people.
this brutality is normal in india cause the institution never really changed with rest of the country. background checks won't help because no one comes into the force with pent-up rage. they're all normal like us until they get into the cauldron where corruption, rage, foul mouthing, etc. are all ingested and then spurted out on the public. what we need is a complete revamp where every single policeman is taken through a long training and sensitization and then certified before they are back on the force. but don't forget, this will never happen.  

yesterday, i commented on the lockdown megathread that i am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. my friend (from nodia, wb) is presently living with us (kolkata, wb) for her stage 3 cancer treatment at tata memorial hospital, new town, kolkata. her radiation will be going on for 28 days, monday to friday.

we have hired a car. we carry papers and id (including patient id) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. he stated the reason why he was there. the cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

this is anarchy.

i am not on social media other than reddit and i do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. however, i would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. they are not communicating at all. we are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. i do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

i would also like you all to warn others. and if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. because today, it seemed like you have none. police force hasn't changed much from colonial era. most of these cops come from backward villages. there mostly uneducated folks. they have never been taught that they are civil servants. 
internet is full of such incidences where cops are seen beating civilians to a pulp. and mind you , only a tiny fraction of such incidences get recorded on camera.  they do far worse off camera. 

but make no mistake, this is not going to go. not anytime soon. not in our lifetime atleast. why? because people are okay with it. they have accepted it. they believe that's what police do. that's what they are for. you don't believe me? go read the comments on facebook on such videos. you are likely to find people laughing and sharing edited versions of these videos with a funny background music or laugh. if the police continue the same brutality, we will have some major incidence of clashes between police and public. not all people coming out are roaming for entertainment. the people are very afraid and confused. don't play with fire. yeah, it's shocking how normalised police brutality is in india. strict action must be taken against these officers. it’s not only during the lockdown, but they have always been like this and they need to start respecting the citizens of the country. are there any laws against police officers doing this? in civilised countries when u see the police u feel a sense of relief. india on the other hand... don't insult animals by comparing the indian police with them.", meme_femme dlisfyn rpvirtuoso HeresyLight l34df4rm3r OptimusPrime3600 AnxiousBlock enlightened_penis chronicleblast InterimNihilist depressedfrog420,cops uncontrollable animals pent up rage waiting unleash civilians disclaimer videos seen say this know policemn certain subset police fall category subset still needs addressed honestly go r publicfreakout see dozens videos policemen beating life disobey now understand victims said videos undoubtedly foolish following see cops videos cannot wait beat hello citizens forgotten live cultured civilisation leads mento opinion must rigorous background checking taking police officers force corrupt officers common shame general populus alright that please need stricter criteria accepting police officers onto workforce

jai shri ram. our judiciary is compromised(sc judgements), our financial system is compromised (controlling rbi), our legislative is compromised (operation kamala everywhere), our .... 

so no wonder the media & their ethics are compromised too. 

the only thing, which i often say, that is helping the govt  stay afloat financially is the low crude prices (helping mop up lots of money as taxes) and liquor sales (in most states). it & gst is anyways nowhere near the required levels.

new delhi — the media one anchorman vinesh kunhiraman went on air as usual on march 6, ready to tell the station’s five million viewers in india’s kerala state about the death anniversary of a beloved comedian and the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic.

just a few minutes into the broadcast, he saw the managing editor rush to the studio floor, gesturing wildly. “i realized something was not right,” mr. kunhiraman recalled.

the station’s uplink suddenly went dead. mr. kunhiraman’s image dissolved into a blue screen. a bland message told viewers there was no signal. “we regret the inconvenience,” it said.

but this was no technical difficulty. the station had been cut off by an order from india’s ministry of information and broadcasting. the government decided to block the channel for 48 hours because it had covered february’s biggest news story — the mob attacks on muslims in new delhi that flared into broader unrest — in a way that seemed “critical toward delhi police and r.s.s.,” the order said.

the r.s.s. is a hindu-nationalist social movement with close ties to prime minister narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party.

“it was shocking the central government took such a decision,” said r. subhash, an editor at media one. “it was an attack on the freedom of the press.”

india’s free press has played a crucial role in protecting this country’s democracy since its independence from britain in 1947. but journalists here now feel under attack.

since mr. modi came to power in 2014, they say, his government has tried to control the country’s news media, especially the airwaves, like no other prime minister in decades. mr. modi has shrewdly cultivated the media to build a cult of personality that portrays him as the nation’s selfless savior.

at the same time, senior government officials have pressed news outlets — berating editors, cutting off advertising, ordering tax investigations — to ignore the uglier side of his party’s campaign to transform india from a tolerant, religiously diverse country into an assertively hindu one.

with the coronavirus pandemic, mr. modi has gotten more blatant in his attempt to control coverage and, as with other difficult stories, some indian news executives seem willing to go along.

right before he [announced the world’s largest coronavirus lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html), on 1.3 billion people, mr. modi [met with top news executives](https://caravanmagazine.in/media/hours-before-lockdown-modi-asked-print-media-owners-editors-refrain-negative-covid-coverage) and urged them to [publish “inspiring and positive stories”](https://www.narendramodi.in/prime-minister-narendra-modi-interacts-with-print-media-journalists-and-stakeholders-548937) about the government’s efforts. then, after the [lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html) stranded half a million migrant workers, with [some dying along the highways](https://thewire.in/rights/coronavirus-national-lockdown-migrant-workers-dead), his lawyers persuaded the supreme court this week to [order all media](https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/coronavirus-lockdown-fake-news-and-panic-driven-migration-caused-untold-misery-to-migrant-labourers-supreme-court-read-order) to “publish the official version” of coronavirus developments, although outlets are still allowed to carry independent reporting.

an association of leading broadcasters was quick to praise the court decision, which many intellectuals said was yet another attack on india’s constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech.

through an aide, india’s information and broadcasting minister, prakash javadekar, initially agreed to discuss the government’s media policies. but in the two weeks since then, mr. javadekar has declined to answer any questions, including a written list emailed to him. his aide cited the demands of the coronavirus crisis.

india’s media universe is vast, perhaps the biggest in the world: more than 17,000 newspapers, 100,000 magazines, 178 television news channels and countless websites in dozens of languages. thousands of facebook pages call themselves news publishers, and youtube is filled with local bulletins on everything from real estate trends to police raids.

but mr. modi’s ministers have leaned on business leaders to cut off support to independent media, slowly strangling their operations. his government has pressured media owners to fire journalists who have criticized the prime minister and told them to stop running features like hate-crime trackers that have embarrassed mr. modi’s party.

mr. modi is backed up by an army of online allies who discredit and harass independent journalists; female journalists, in particular, have been besieged with abuse and rape threats. and the [police say hindu nationalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/world/asia/india-lankesh-kalburgi-gun.html) were behind the [2017 murder of gauri lankesh](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/magazine/gauri-lankesh-murder-journalist.html), a female newspaper editor hailed as one of india’s most crusading journalists.

like other populist leaders, mr. modi and his ministers bristle at any public criticism, whether from [business executives](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/day-after-rahul-bajaj-spoke-up-bjp-and-ministers-hit-back-6145942/), [foreign leaders](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/caa-in-eu-parliament-european-parliament-to-not-vote-on-caa-to-thursday/story/394966.html), or even [schoolchildren](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/karnataka-school-sedition-case-challenged-in-supreme-court-2183845).

and for the most part, indian news outlets have knuckled under, concluding that since much of the public supports the prime minister, they should, too. even skeptical journalists censor themselves, afraid to be branded anti-national by a government that equates patriotism with support for mr. modi.

his government has also imposed the strictest restrictions on foreign journalists in decades, suddenly and without explanation. visas have been tightened, and foreign journalists have been banned from hotbeds of unrest such as northeast india and jammu and kashmir, a muslim-majority area that was stripped of its statehood in august and put under [a severe crackdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/world/asia/kashmir-doctors-phone.html).

the kashmir story was seismic, but many indian journalists, looking back on it, feel that they toed the government line and overlooked grave human rights abuses.

“we didn’t do justice to the big story,’’ said rajdeep sardesai, one of the country’s leading news anchors. “we should have gone out there and reported the situation from the ground aggressively and independently.’’

there were security restrictions on where indian reporters could go, mr. sardesai said, but he admitted it was more than that.

“a large section of the indian media,” he said, “has become a lap dog, not a watchdog.” [removed]", TendarCoconut Imaginary_Pumpkin adchait satyasys sanwfa shy_boy_good rig_vedic_sage tormaake Mechgandhi internet-junkie None,modi press free anymore

Fabulous-Rice,2020-03-16,Politics,180,1078,False,,"banks wrote off rs 6,60,000 crore worth bad loans since modi came to power",https://www.newsclick.in/Non-Performing-Assets-Modi-Government-Loan-Write-Offs-RBI-Data," these are the banks who denied me student loan. congress - scams in private and gets fucked.
bjp - scams in public and nobody cares. need more details on which are those banks and who are the lenders this isn't exactly surprising. the write-offs have increased in recent times because of the basic tenets of economic system, i.e. it is going to be as good as the humans.

ideally, when you borrow $100 today and promise to repay it on a given date a year later (with interest), you are essentially asking your future self (of 1 year ahead) to reduce his expenses by $100+interest in order to increase your expenses by $100 today.

the debt taken can be classified in two major ways

1. debt to fuel productivity e.g. a loan to buy a truck that increases your productivity, making it easier to transport things in turn increasing your income, making it easier to repay.
2. debt to fuel overspending e.g. a loan to buy tvs, acs and everything else that you cannot afford, this debt doesn't increase productivity or income and just consumes it.

if you're undertaking first kind of debt, your future self will feel it easier to repay since his income would have increased because of this debt, but in case of the second kind of debt, your future self will not get any ease in repaying since his income haven't changed because of the undertaken debt. **and therefore the premise, not all debt is bad, just the once that don't increase productivity are.**

humans being humans are always susceptible to corruption, if i have $100, i might go get a book on cybersecurity or i might go to an imax movie show. the first one will increase my accumulated knowledge and as a result my productivity while the second one will just be a waste of money. **it's just the vanilla human nature, inclination to borrow more, spend more and pay less.**

*in the wake of 2007-2009 financial crisis across the world, india made it easier to borrow money, and everyone borrowed in bulk, some to increase their productivity and some to sustain their extravagant lifestyle. over the time, due to interest piling up and incomes not increasing much (because you didn't use the debt to make yourself more productive), people were unable to repay their loans and then the defaults started. some of the banks, in order to make their loan book look better by showing less defaults/npas, might've refinanced the loans, further increasing the amount to be repaid.* i need to know how much, what percentage of these are to poor farmers. 

npas increased because the process of evergreening stopped. 

at one point of time you will come into the same  conclusion..

write off is a logical conclusion when other options ran out.

>a lot of the loans currently classified as npas originated in the mid-2000s, at a time when the economy was booming and business outlook was very positive. large corporations were granted loans for projects based on extrapolation of their recent growth and performance. 

>but as economic growth stagnated following the global financial crisis of 2008, the repayment capability of these corporations decreased.

>this contributed to what is now known as india’s twin balance sheet problem

>the banks at this time took to the practice of ‘evergreening’, where fresh loans were given to some promoters to enable them to pay off their interest. this effectively pushed the recognition of these loans as non-performing to a later date, but did not address the root causes of their unprofitability.

>further, recently there have also been frauds of high magnitude that have contributed to rising npas. 

>the insolvency and bankruptcy code (ibc) was enacted in may 2016 to provide a time-bound 180-day recovery process for insolvent accounts

>under the ibc, the creditors of these insolvent accounts, presided over by an insolvency professional, decide whether to restructure the loan, or to sell the defaulter’s assets to recover the outstanding amount.

second written off doesn’t mean the defaulter/borrower  has no liability. his liability exists the same. all the criminal/civil lawsuits and sarfaesi action will continue as usual. 

the problem isn’t writing off bad loans . it’s the increasing amount of stressed loans that are turning into npa due to economic slowdown. nda's complicity alone can't be held responsible for this, we saw the same under upa. this would perhaps continue to happen inevitably until they implement the norms as per nayak committee. first of all what is the source of this news? one should know this before making a comment... positive or negative... it's kind of a good thing that the npas are being acknowledged and written off. without raghuram rajan's initiative this wouldn't have happened. 

it would be interesting to see which companies were given the loan and when. also would be important to analyse which companies were give a loan recently and are unable to meet their debt payments. someone please r/explainlikeimfive this!", r2d2v1 rg102 pramodc84 None r2d2v1 drgnfly61 swingtothedrive Hawkey89 vineetgupta2001 con-slut JainAAviral,banks wrote rs 6 60 000 crore worth bad loans since modi came power

even if proven wrong, there is always the 'morarji desai' approach. bad news for sanghis, rss and all the fucking idiots itt: many folks complaining that the title is misleading since there have been no actual tests conducted - ***because the scientists are irritated that they have to spend time and resources behind such a wild claim*** - rather than undertaking more important research.

so my new question is - if there is a large scale experiment where the effects are actually monitored & documented - do you reckon people will *actually sign up for it*.... and willingly put themselves in the mix ""for science"". **~~op~~ the link that op has used,  has put a really misleading title. clickbait as best.** 

eli5 : indian gov wants scientists to do more research on all things cow and scientists don't wanna get into this mess.

>the main reason why the scientists are not too keen to carry forth this research is because they believe that glorifying cow products will undermine the credibility of scientific achievements especially when a lot of research has been carried out in the field of cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure and none of these ailments are mentioned in the ancient texts.  neither do they have a verified source of cow products actually curing any of these diseases.  


i'm honestly disappointed. science has always been skeptical about ~~claims and~~ extraordinary claims being made without evidence, i wonder why they said no to the perfect opportunity to conclusively end this whole debate on the so called benefits of cow ~~using~~ urine and cow dung. while their argument does make sense , there's nothing to lose to apply the sharp sword of the scientific method to gauge such outlandish claims. uhhmm... misleading title. at least it doesn't have negative effects like coke or something, so that's a win!

instead, the islamic spokespersons appearing on the news  are aggressively defending the jamat's asinine attitude. they call for the news to stop demonizing islam at large but don't realize that the jamat incident gave godi media and the bhakts the perfect scapegoat and excuse to continue ostracising muslims.

instead of adamantly defending what is universally being considered a dumb move which is going to hurt a lot of people, and i don't just refer to the coronavirus, these spokespersons should be mature and just apologize on behalf of the jamat.

knowing the history of the jamat, godi media and bhakts, these factions will never see the bigger picture. each wants to serve their own ends and feed their own delusions. if the muslim community truly wants to defeat unwarranted prejudice, they must be more mature and put the community before their beliefs. things will change for the better eventually, but they need to change themselves first. instead of going to supreme court, try to bridge damage done,accept mistake, apologise, come in main stream and show you care for this country and its brothers living in it.

times like this makes me value dr. manmohan singh. he would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. a party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. a finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. a home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. if he can murder muslims, he can watch hindus die too - a murderer is a murderer). a history graduate in rbi with a wet noodle for a spine. a society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


dr. singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. i hope the bjp, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a pr firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like congress, tmc, cpim, aap which have quite a bit of expertise by indian political standards. i hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

also folks telling me this is a low effort post - i put more effort than the prime minister and i am not even elected by you. 

and folks speaking about the strong leadership of marendra nodi - the over centralisation of his government has resulted in one very incapable man doing a lot of stupid things hurting a lot of people. he is a narcissist and doesn't care about people. at the same time there is a distinct lack of ideas at the center.",missing dr. manmohan singh 😞,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fva9mi/missing_dr_manmohan_singh/," history is written by the victors. 

the wave of right-wing nationalism has only begun and will continue unless nipped in the bud or countered by an equal and opposite wave. the chances of either of those happening anytime soon is rather low. 

this bunch sees everything in black and white - no understanding of the concept of nuance. they have shown that by constantly shitting on the first pm of india. i don't think they will show dr. singh much quarter, sadly. the smallest dog barks the loudest i've lived through that. 2013 uttarakhand calamity. the centre was not at all responsive and late af in recognising the severity of the situation. apun ko sardar mangta🇮🇳😤 manmohan singh was a great finance minister. that's it.

the upa was no better than the current government. yes, they are not openly islamophobic but that's pretty much the only pro they have over bjp. they were riddled with scams and the pm played second fiddle to sonia. unless they get their shit together and elect an able leader or aap somehow manages to woo voters nationally, the current government has nothing to worry about for the next decade. and that's a scary thought. both of them wouldn't do jack shit to help you in your day-to-day life. spend time with family, take care of your loved ones and hope all of us pull through this. we simply use these comparisons as a reason to fool ourselves. maybe people have forgotten nirbhaya protestor being hosed down and the deluge of npas from loans freely handed out during upa ii and the thousand other things wrong with that administration that resulted in the nda sweeping everywhere in 2014.

nevermind that he was always subservient to the party and had nowhere near the authority that a prime minister should command.

this whitewashing of the upa is an injustice to history. upa ii and was a colossal failure and so was manmohan singh as prime minister. how old were you when he was pm? the ungodly bifurcation on ap still haunts the state his cm ys rajashekar reddy gave away millions in fees reimbursement which encouraged many asshats to open fake colleges and reduced the quality of engineering less than zero, and that's just in my state. don't be so edgy buddy ,you might trip and fall of the cliff well he was highly educated but lacked spine. even his own party didn't give any shit about him. he was misused by gandhi's and he knew that but still went on serving them.

also tmc really?? the party which still continues to defecate in name of democracy, whose leader puts people in jail just bcoz a meme was made on her.

also a very low effort post the way he is afraid of reporters is too much. n now they are reopening case of ndtv again. claiming that upa finance minister was great is the most bogus claims that i have heard in recent past. i want to know how we are in current economic scenario go and read about twin balance sheet problem. npa's where a ticking bomb and they have taken economy down with it. and by the regarding npa's insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 is one great economic reforms past in last few years.

i do agree that manmohan singh was a great economist but he was a poor pm.

and about schemes not favouring poor go and read about ayushman bharat yojna. pm humility in first speech is compared to no one accepting that our health care system is poor and we need lockdown to control the spread and seen nothing as less.

such generalizations not only hurt national unity but also that muslims have to face hatred from some people who were otherwise neutral or united. if modi didn’t announce lockdown yogi adityanath was hell bent on conducting ram navami in ayodya for 7 days with millions of devotees from the region. it was never announced postponed but stopped only by modi’s lockdown announcement. 

do not add religious colours to this stupidity. it’s just stupidity, there’s no religion associated with stupidity, it’s all the people. 

you have divided this country enough, stop. [removed] now the government has found their scapegoats in muslims, if the virus spreads further they can conveniently blame them for it. there is audience which will lap this up.

parvdave,2020-04-03,Politics,76,242,False,"so today i woke up to my parents discussing how mangal is crossing something, rahu, ketu something, shit related to astrology basically. and then they signed it off by saying that modi is smart and he planned this entire thing keeping all of these nakshatra shit in mind. they read this on whatsapp and started telling me all of this and say that this is a scientific method and how this will weaken the spread.

i got super triggered at the scientific line and said that it's pseudo-science not real science.

then my mum tells me that all of this astrology shit has been followed for centuries in our country and even rulers followed it. 

bhenchod, itna hi sahi hai toh haar kyu gaye mughal aur british se chutiyo. 

didn't say this of course, now my father jumps in and shoves it in my face that modi chutiya hai and that he's stupid and all of them are stupid. if i don't wish to follow these things then i should get rid of that thread i was given as a brahmin child,  and stop having his name in my full name and make ends meet all by myself. stop being this mr. cool and that i won't amount to anything????

how does that culminate into him bombarding me with insults? how do i deal with such a situation?",parents would choose modi over me at this point,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu54ht/parents_would_choose_modi_over_me_at_this_point/," even i am stunned to see how well the the social media marketing is managed, announcement was made at 9 am, and by afternoon we have images, videos, scientific theories, expert opinions and all sorts of shit all over the internet. get a large framed modi picture and perform pooja to it daily.. show your bhakti and they'll turn back >now my father jumps in and shoves it in my face that modi chutiya hai and that he's stupid and all of them are stupid. if i don't wish to follow these things then i should get rid of that thread i was given as a brahmin child, and stop having his name in my full name

please don't hate me for this but this part got me laffing (just a little).

that culminates because we underestimate the conservatism and orthodoxy that prevails in india. the ""old-fashioned"" ideologies that we roll our eyes over and ignore can cause serious consequences in society. you have to start filtering out when they say shit like this. nothing you are going to say will change their mind. so don't bother lecturing them. it's an exercise in futility.

finish studies, get a job and move out. then decide for yourselves what you want to do with that thread and if you want to pass it on to your children. join them do poojas in front of the supreme leaders picture make you parents do it too and if they don't call them deshdrohis first things first, turn on all the lights at home @9.01 pm. as soon as you get a job, you announce your conversion to priesthood and tell them you are denouncing all moha and relations to find the eternal moksha. and go live a happy life in new city with your new found freedom. you dont. at least not by getting triggered. you gotta understand that after certain age, there is a rigidity in changing your beliefs and you wont change theirs by argument. if you love and care for your parents and want them to change, you got a long struggle in front of you. i've got some ideas on how, if you're interested, i'll type it out. 


otherwise, just ignore, move out when you can, and teach your child the scientific method. cult members choose their leader over family. i recommend reading up on deprogramming cult members and using their techniques.

since the story is in hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by dainik bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

ashwani kumar, secretary to the chief minister of gujarat, told a news agency - ""around 1800 people from different districts of gujarat were stranded in haridwar. with the special efforts of union minister mansukhbhai mandaviya and chief minister vijay rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” as a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of uttarakhand transport reached ahmedabad from haridwar. interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

an order issued on march 27 shows that these vehicles of uttarakhand transport were sent directly to gujarat *under the instructions of the chief minister's office*. their purpose was to bring the people of gujarat trapped in haridwar to their homes. **while returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the uttarakhand government.**

workers from uttarakhand (working in ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

mukesh kumar says- ""the next morning, on march 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. we were 13 companions a bus. **the driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to rishikesh.** we found it strange but we had no choice. we were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. we thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. but that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

instead of uttarakhand, these buses dropped mukesh and his companions midway. some were dropped off in harayana, and some in rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

it is being said that all these people from gujarat had reached haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. these people are supposedly close to the prime minister and the home minister. **it is also clear from the official statement of ashwani kumar, secretary to the chief minister of gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the home minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

on the other hand there are people like mukesh kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

---

all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.","during lockdown, uttarakhand cm (on amit shah's orders) arranged 28 buses to transport 1800 gujarati devotees stranded in haridwar back to ahmedabad. uttarakhand workers in ahmedabad were then duped of rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu7wnt/during_lockdown_uttarakhand_cm_on_amit_shahs/," my god what a total मादरचोद my state cm is. tadipar gang now started looting other state government? what kind of depravity is this? and people were asking, where home minister amit shah has disappeared... he was busy coordinating such cover ups... this was horrible to read. if evil had a face then it's modi-shah. no one even comes close.

is this what we are reduced to as indians? they should rename themselves to gujarat janata party cause they ain't bharatiya remember when kejri said ""it would be great if all states would have health care system like us so that they don't need to come all over here"" and bjp/rss bhaj-bhaj mandali were blaming him to be partial and a 'divider'.

well it smells like hypocrisy, isn't it. sahi pakde hain. bhakts have been grabbed by the balls now. on a serious note, feel sad how those who wanted to return back to uttarakhand were dealt with. > it is also clear from the official statement of ashwani kumar, secretary to the chief minister of gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the home minister directly.

this should be investigated against the home minster, as these people are potential threat vectors to others and this is an abuse of power by home minister. and, this is a scenario where rich and connected get taken care of but ordinary people don't.

> the driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to rishikesh. we found it strange but we had no choice. we were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. we thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. but that didn't happen either. '

this should be investigated, but my guess is since the driver didn't take these people to uttarakhand, it might have been the driver scamming them. well why was this done during lockdown for these people? any special reason ? and if an exception was made for these people surely the same can be made for others too. religion, wealth, skin color or caste does not make you superior - only your acts do. the day we understand this, india will progress.", indi_n0rd satyasys ThrowRAqwertyui LegitimateAge notanothervoice Meraxes373 rig_vedic_sage diaop dontknow_anything manofsteel911 shyamalamasingsong,uttarakhand cm on amit shah orders arranged 28 buses transport 1800 gujarati devotees stranded haridwar back ahmedabad uttarakhand workers ahmedabad duped rs 18000 stranded midway tried use buses return home link story bhaskar db original news amit shah vijay rupani latest updates on gujarat pilgrims return from haridwar rishikesh over coronavirus 127094521 html since story hindi here summary events reported dainik bhaskar ग जर त क म ख यम त र क सच व अश वन क म र न एक न य ज एज स क बत य ग जर त क अलग अलग ज ल क कर ब 1800 ल ग हर द व र म फ स ह ए थ क द र य म त र मनस खभ ई म डव य और म ख यम त र व जय र प ण क व श ष प रय स स इन ल ग क वह स न क लकर इनक घर पह च न क व यवस थ क गई इस व यवस थ क चलत उत तर ख ड पर वहन क कई ग ड य हर द व र स अहमद ब द पह च थ द लचस प ह क य क म इतन ग पन यत स क य गय क उत तर ख ड क पर वहन म त र तक क य खबर नह लग क उनक व भ ग क कई ग ड य ल कड उन क द र न कई र ज य क स म ओ क प र करत ह ए 1200 क ल म टर क सफर पर न कल च क ह ashwani kumar secretary chief minister gujarat told news agency around 1800 different districts gujarat stranded haridwar special efforts union minister mansukhbhai mandaviya chief minister vijay rupani arrangements made evacuate homes result arrangement many vehicles uttarakhand transport reached ahmedabad haridwar interestingly work done secrecy transport minister uttarakhand news many buses department traversed distances nearly 1200 km crossing borders many states 27 म र च क ज र एक आद श स म ल म पड त ह क उत तर ख ड पर वहन क य ग ड य स ध प रद श क म ख यम त र क र य लय क न र द श क तहत ग जर त भ ज गई थ इनक उद द श य हर द व र म फ स ग जर त क ल ग क उनक घर पह च न थ व पस ल टत ह ए यह ग ड य वह फ स उत तर ख ड क ल ग क ल कर आ सकत थ ल क न ऐस क ई भ आद श उत तर ख ड सरक र क ओर स ज र नह ह आ order issued march 27 shows vehicles uttarakhand transport sent directly gujarat under instructions chief minister office purpose bring gujarat trapped haridwar homes while returning vehicles could brought uttarakhand stranded there order issued uttarakhand workers uttarakhand working ahmedabad wished return home came know buses friends back home म क श क म र बत त ह अगल स बह य न 29 म र च क कर ब 10 बज हम सब ल ग इन बस क प स पह च गए हम 13 स थ एक बस थ हम र बस क ड र इवर न फ र हमस कह क त म ह ऋष क श तक क क ल 18 हज र र पए क र य च क न ह ग य हम अज ब त लग ल क न हम र प स क ई व कल प भ नह थ मजब र थ इसल ए हम त य र ह गए और हम 13 ल ग न म लकर त र त ह 18 हज र र पए ड र इवर क थम द ए हम लग थ क चल इस म श क ल वक त म हम कम स कम क स भ तरह अपन घर त पह च ज ए ग ल क न व भ नह ह आ mukesh kumar says the next morning march 29 around 10 o clock reached near buses 13 companions bus the driver bus told us pay total fare 18 thousand rupees rishikesh found strange choice helpless got ready immediately gave 18 thousand rupees driver thought least difficult somehow reach home happen either म क श और उनक स थ य क उत तर ख ड पर वहन क इन बस न अहमद ब द स ब ठ त ल य ल क न उत तर ख ड पह चन स पहल ह र त क अ ध र म क स क र जस थ न त क स क हर य ण म ह उत र द य instead uttarakhand buses dropped mukesh companions midway dropped harayana rajasthan बत य ज रह ह क ग जर त क य तम म ल ग क स ध र म क अन ष ठ न म श म ल ह न हर द व र पह च थ प रध नम त र और ग ह म त र क अपन प रद श स आए इन ल ग क उनक कर ब भ बत य ज रह ह ग जर त क म ख यम त र क सच व अश वन क म र क आध क र क बय न स भ इतन त स फ ह त ह ह क जह द शभर म ल ख ल ग यह वह फ स ह ए ह वह हर द व र म फ स इन ल ग क स ध ग ह म त र क न ज हस तक ष प क ब द व श ष व यवस थ करक न क ल गय ह said gujarat reached haridwar participate religious ritual supposedly close prime minister home minister clear official statement ashwani kumar secretary chief minister gujarat millions trapped across country trapped haridwar taken special intervention home minister directly द सर तरफ म क श क म र ज स ल ग ह ज न ह न अपन प रद श क ग ड य क आत द ख अपन घर ल ट प न क उम म द प ल थ ल क न व अब तक भ अधर म लटक ह ए ह hand mukesh kumar expected able return homes seeing buses coming state stranded animals equal animals equal others

but this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. no bjp does not represent hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. what part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting bjp's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

something much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. a couple of points

1. i think india is inherently fragile. bjp has not invented something, they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines. another thing is that there are so many people who vote for bjp because they are so fed up with the opposition. 

i don’t know exactly but rahul gandhi wouldn’t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village. 

2. a substantial part of this country do not care about democracy. people don’t like having to make difficult decisions.

don’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my pov. bjp stands for divisive politics. in a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. a place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. bjp is being run like an efficient political business so i don't see when and how it can be stopped. if you kill in the name of religion, your god has already forsaken you.           
- unknown though i appreciate what you are saying, majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are saying.
lack of education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion. your actions show your real motives, not your words. going by your logic, there is no real reason muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law in the us, you say ""chinese virus"" and people will call your a racist. 

in india, you say ""corona jihad"" you're a nationalist.

given that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity. i think in hindsight it was better to announce a schedule for the lockdown a few days earlier, transfer funds to their accounts, run maximum number of trains and buses to take everybody back home, let people prepare and stock up, and then start the police curfew lathi raj. instead, under the excuse of ""preventing panic"", they started with the last first, and now people can neither stay in cities nor go back to their homes, neither have food nor money. *“recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and  ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to  him.”*     

 ―        mahatma gandhi the worst thing is he has been asking people for staying back for a number of days now.  still, the anti-kejriwal propoganda is too high in up right now i don't think modi has consulted with state heads before declaring the lock-down and given them some time to prepare or listen to them which could have avoided mass exodus from cities like delhi. this guy literally enforces ""na khaunga, na khane dunga"" - he won't prepare and won't allow other able leaders to prepare at state level. jokes on kejri

its a man sacrificing himself to save 6 other men.

it was the actions of a man to save his fellow men. the image representation should be the other away around. as in, ram praying to the burning victim. i don’t really like this cartoon, instead of praying the guy actually went there and saved people, it’s complete opposite of what gods do (they do nothing) and their devotees do (pray instead of doing something). okay. i  understand how this can be confusing but here is how i see it, (and maybe how it was meant to be seen) --

lord ram, who gave up his kingdom and his wife, because of duties and people - the same man who recognized another king and made him king, and then went on to another country to find his wife, and on the way, ate what an old lady had eaten, he is now welcoming the man who instead of looking at religions, looked at people in need, recognized their suffering, and took action to his own detriment. this man, whom ram wants and cherishes, because ram is the one who created the universe and all in it, shree ram does not care which religion we choose because he created us to learn and believe and experience so that we can be better than the sum of our parts. because shree ram is the greater of us and yet we are the ~~ram that is~~ hanuman for him, because we carry those ideas and the ideals and we can act on them like the man burning in the picture does.

marrmalayde,2020-04-07,Politics,67,78,False,"i hate the godi media so much right now. during the lockdown i was visiting my parents. we live in a large joint family setting. now my every morning starts with hindu muslim hate speech as newspapers (hindi) are read and tv news channels are put on loud. of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. i isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
what’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. they call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “tj ke bare mein suna apne? gaddar hain ye log. modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. inka ek hi ilaaj hai. line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”
since yesterday, when news broke of some guy getting shot for saying tj is behind coronavirus in india, they are targeting me with sarcastic and laced with toxicity pseudo-debates. pseudo because they don’t really want to engage in discussion, they only want to humiliate me for my views. maybe they secretly think i’m a gaddar too. 
i’m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but i cannot till lockdown is lifted. now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. i’m feeling so trapped and it’s disturbing my mental peace. i don’t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day. any advice on how to stay sane will be helpful.",what do you do when your own family subscribes to the ‘goli maaro’ ideology? [rant],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwdgbn/what_do_you_do_when_your_own_family_subscribes_to/," try this: find muslims figures that all indians love - musicians, movie stars, cricket players, abdul kalam, top army generals, etc. 

start bad mouthing them. say how the army general is a traitor for being willing to die for his country. how abdul kalam was a traitor for building the missiles. etc. etc. 

see how they react. hopefully you can confuse them enough to start thinking for themselves.

edit/add: this is not a problem you should run away from. you have to fight, cleverly, and win. otherwise the whole country is at stake. you have to take them on, use your brain. ask them which one of them is ready to do it and whats stopping them.

i call this the veer savarkar model of bravery: keep up the fear-mongering and hate waiting for some numbnut to do the deed on their behalf. don't take their talks literally, but try to enjoy the silliness, to add to the fun, you should ask much more sillier questions related to these topics which would make them feel important, and then go back to your room and have a laugh. run as far as possible and life your life on your own terms. you can't change them. but you can change your situation. assuming they won't kill you while you are asleep, your best tool to get around, in this case, is sarcasm. the interesting thing about sarcasm is that it lets you vent out without an open confrontation. once lockdown is over let us know here that you made it back to your place alive! bro cut the cable my mom was on the verge of becoming this due to whatsapp. the method i used is to react to her arguments with dry sarcasm that makes her look like a fool. when she felt embarrassed she'd ask my take on it and i'd explain. boomers have high ego and won't admit that they are wrong, the only way to get them to drop this bs is by making the said ideology appear beneath them. argue with them, and make it clear i'm not backing down. 

as for you, calm yourself. ignore them when possible, or use below the belt jibes to keep them off centre.

remember. it's not about being right. it's about showing dominance. so you just have to make them feel not in control. good to know at least 1 person in your family is sane. hopefully the rest will come around over time. i wish you all the best bro, i had a similar discussion with my family and i already told them..... you go your own way and i my own, if religion and modi is above basic human decency for you, you may as well consider your son a muslim 

since that day, they call, i inform them i am good and that's it. no talk and excuse me, but i have things to do.

same for my relatives, i have stopped interacting with religious fanatics and modi bhakts. i used to ignore my dad, but now my sister and mom have also joined the hate mongering. so, now ""i am good, had my food and i am busy"" this will fizz out on it's own once the lockdown ends. no one will have time to watch news this much then. this is just a phase. focus on ghar ka khaana and other positive things. your folks are still the same people. they're just impressionable. don't give up on family.", juliechamp kyunahi doggiesangel pampara_vitti rented_rainbow SaMapper hystyic PM_GeniusAPWBD InterimNihilist ajmanyu Serac_E,family subscribes goli maaro ideology rant hate godi media much right now visiting parents live large joint family setting every morning starts hindu muslim hate speech newspapers hindi read tv news channels put loud course haven t subscribed remotely sane news channel isolate small room back house away shrill voice frothing mouth anchors permeates everything what worse fed daily dose toxicity family members discuss day glee call distant relatives say stuff tj ke bare mein suna apne gaddar hain ye log modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye inka ek hi ilaaj hai line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko since yesterday news broke guy getting shot saying tj behind coronavirus targeting sarcastic laced toxicity pseudo debates pseudo don t really want engage discussion want humiliate views maybe secretly think gaddar too desperate house back home another city cannot till lifted seems may happen 14th planned earlier feeling trapped disturbing mental peace don t know deal much toxicity hate everyday day day advice stay sane helpful

>prime minister of india 

>dear prime minister, i would like to convey to you my solidarity along with that of millions of congress party workers at this time of immense humanitarian crisis. we are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the coronavirus outbreak in india. 

>the world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the covid-19 virus and india is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. i must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. 

>it is critical for us to understand that india's conditions are unique. we may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. the number of poor people in india who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. the consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the covid-19 virus. 

>it is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.

> millions of india’s elderly live in villages. a complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. this will result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

>we must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. the financial package announced by the government is a good first step. but speedy delivery of the package is important. please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. it is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. at the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus’s spread in order to contain it. 

>the government’s sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. it is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. they are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. they are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. it is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. 

>it is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. it is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. 

>we stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge.

if he was pm we would never have demo, convoluted gst, dilution of rti , public spat with rbi and so on. we got massively fucked in 2014. he's just talking about a bunch of too-general things like separating young from old etc. what the fuck?  
without lockdown, economy would be in a bigger freefall. economy free fall was inevitable.

if people would have been willing to listen to me, in his place i'd have asked solely for cash transfers for the poor, as that is the only way to keep people inside homes.

and allow essentials to be bought for sure, as is being done. i am seeing many people are opposing the lock down because of the many problems being faced by the people of our country. but, i don't see anyone saying anything about what has to be done. in this current situation what other options to be considered and implemented? wait till modi takes matter from this letter and turns it into his new speech. mitroooon!

- so there was no roadway to reach the temple? 
- why did he need to hoist a flag on some temple--where did the flag come from?

let me tell you what the average american thinks, from my conversation with co-workers:

""who did 9/11? the muslims.""

""who's been fighting us in the middle east for twenty years? the muslims.""

""who  keeps mounting terrorist attacks in other european countries (paris,  london, berlin) and being a general pain in the ass? muslims again.""

""who are the people who have been flooding into europe *en masse,* with all the sexual assault and begging for handouts that you'd expect? *the muslims.""*

""the indians are killing the muslims? *good.* i hope they get them all.""

it's  the same as with the complete lack of interest in the syrian war. the  popular view is that it's good that the muslims are being genocided. and muslims should understand that there is nothing to fear about caa-nrc. it is this lack of understanding due to which the angry hindu mob have to kill them. once the muslims stop fearing caa and stop protesting, they don't have to fear the hindu mob also. i don't believe that modi is like hitler.....

china is the reason we're in this mess. looking past the issue with their markets, they hid the true scale and devastation of this virus for more than a month because it would've made them look incompetent.

if the potency of the virus was known beforehand, governments worldwide could've implemented preventive measures well before this thing spiralled out of control. we could've been further along in terms of testing, cures and vaccines. china essentially set everyone back by trying to hide the effects of the virus.

retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. this means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers to pay their employees salary while acting like caring, charitable employers.

and don't even talk about the ceo forgoing an entire year of his salary. when you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap pr bullshit. and let's not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.

2.the gesture for driver relief is much appreciated , they are not obliged to pay the drivers, the drivers earn on a commission basis the demand , they are already doing the bit they can .
3. i also saw a series of articles on how they are working with the govt for waivers on auto loans for their driver community 
- let’s not take the pitch fork each time , and be grateful atleast 
4.i will not choose to comment on the salary piece, i personally think it’s a good gesture note that his net worth is also including ola shares , which are valuable only if the company does well , which he is working very hard towards

( made some punctuation changes ) this post sounds like you just want to get on the anti-capitalism bandwagon. and i say all this without bias. i'm no fan of ola. i wouldn't take their rides even if they offered me free service.

1. ola had 15 lakh drivers as of 2019. even if it were to give everyone just rs 2,000 as a one-time gesture, that's 300 crores. i guess most would agree you need, at the very least, rs 5000 to get thru this period. that's 750 crores.

2. so whether they donate 20 or 50 cr, it doesn't matter. if you were ola management, you'd want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you're going to run short. i'd appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers, instead of bashing such moves.

3. don't forget that they are ultimately a loss-making entity (losing more than 2000 crores every year). they're not raising vc money to channel it all to charity. and, like other comments have mentioned, they don't even have adequate cash in the first place. valuation != cash in hand. do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers? why?

4. ola's top management has already taken salary cuts, with the ceo letting go of his entire annual salary. yeah you could argue it's no biggie as he's still filthy rich. but so what? what more do you want them to do? and why, in the first place? 

so why is this surprising? are you new to capitalism?

vikashred,2020-04-08,Business/Finance,34,75,False,"lets learn something being at home. any doubts you can message me.

if you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

the real thing now is – why we need to invest. it’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . it always fall and it will be same. that’s called inflation.

so, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

so, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

we will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. share market –
i just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

just search in google : reliance share price

at that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. market cap as you see in  is 8.58trillion . so, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .you will know total how many shares are there. share means a part of company. so, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. so, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

company list these share in nse/bse (national stock exchange/bombay stock exchange) .they offer it to people at a lesser price first known as ipo (initial public offering) . so, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

the broker is register with nse/bse and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. you can buy ipo or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. you can open demat account with broker. and trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

for example zerodha, they are india’s largest share broker -




they are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. mutual fund :
mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. so, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

they are of different types:

i. equity mutual fund:

equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
there are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. for example top 50 shares index is called as nifty 50.
a index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

if someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. so, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. debt fund:
debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in government bonds , and company schemes, fd. so, this can be the safest.

iii. there are hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

for a suggestion, there are rating agency, like morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

there are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. it’s free and direct.
you can sign up and use the app to buy. it’s easy.

you may have heard about terms like lumpsum and sip. lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. sip means investing it on montly basis. so, what sip does is ,it averages out your investment . it means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by sip ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. insurance :
insurance means transfer of risk to other . so,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. general insurance
general insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. it is also of different types like

first party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
these are compulsory in india.

ii. life insurance

life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. health insurance:
health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. so if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. term insurance:
term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . so, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

but only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. endowment plans:

if you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . endowment for an example is like this.

you get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

basically, i believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . health insurance is a must though.","finance basics – share market,mutual fund, insurance",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/," thank youuuuuuuu soooooo damnnnnnnn muchhhhm. really appreciate it mate.

yesterday only i was wrapping my head around this as i was thinking of investing in mutual funds as per my friend's reccomendation but was not very clear with everything.

can you please add an example as well for mutual funds for more related information, r/indiainvestments

op fine work, thanks buddy. wouldn't it be better to invest in mutual funds via something like kuvera, paytm money, groww, goalwise etc? any of these non demat platforms instead of zerodha, which i believe stores them on demat account? >  so, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

abbawaddadu,2020-04-04,Business/Finance,21,84,False,"people seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. such as the bad rollout of demonetization, the ilfs issue leading to an npa issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. the consolidation of banks, the issues with yes bank and the impending nbfc crisis. on top of it air india's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, brexit and currently the oil war between saudi arabia and russia.

the virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. the situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. this is a trust issue in the markets and economics. there is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

we will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. the stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. if trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. you haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. for a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. that's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

if a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. on the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. this time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a china propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

it's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. there is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in india tracing far back as 2016. it's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. the investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. i hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",we would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (part rant),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/," actually, corona virus is a great excuse for bjp to blame all their economical problems on. now, for the next few years any question on economy will be diverged to blame corona virus. like, how they blame 70 years of congress for most of indias problems. well written thoughts.

ChelshireGoose,2020-04-03,Business/Finance,23,123,False,"i see a lot of misinformation floating around about the rbi moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, i guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. what prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
when you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan emis what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly emi for the period still left on the loan. so, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly emi is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1l and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). this might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to covid but definitely not otherwise.      

credit cards are a whole other story. their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1l, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in june when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, i'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",psa: don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/," i'm doing the exact opposite - getting some money from savings and quickly closing my credit card bills asap. i can pay debts now, no guarantee how the economy will look after 3 months. is the moratorium automatically applied or do you need to choose it somewhere. because i don't need a moratorium this its another master stroke by rbi to pull in funds if you have crossed the half way mark in your loan tern - then delaying the 3 months of emi is a good thing. 

however, if you are in the first half of your loan term - it's not really worth the effort. what if you use the moratorium to keep some cash and once the situation improves pay it back as a bulk amount. so basically hold on to the cash now and pay it off in a few months.

dannylenwinn,2020-03-09,Business/Finance,40,284,False,,"almost half of indian startups don’t hire women to save on maternity costs: 'roughly 40% of indian women complete higher education and join the workforce, but drop out within the decade because of family commitments.'",https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/03/09/almost-half-of-indian-startups-dont-hire-women-to-save-on-maternity-costs/," got a few issues, this article

>it’s been proven time and time again that diversity is good for business

that sentence contains two links to two different articles, which both link to the [same bcg study](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation.aspx).

so, apparently 

1. writing a new article about an existing study counts as proving that study's outcome one more time
2. the number 'two' qualifies for rhetoric such as 'time and again'
3. we can trust bcg, known for its integrity and independence in social science research and case studies in general

the study itself of course turns out to be a correlational study(you cannot do much better in the world of business i guess; can't ask vcs to do rcts to test out your personal hypotheses) and the numbers might be legit but i wonder about p-hacking.

anyway the crux of the article's argument seems to be this

>though the law was well intended, immediately after it was passed there was a 10% dip in women employees in the country’s total workforce.

i think it's a solid piece of data but still not strong enough to assert the conclusion so confidently.

edit

1. how much did the country's total workforce decline by, as a baseline(in case that 10% dip is in absolute numbers of women employed and not women as a fraction of the workforce)?
2. could there have been other macroeconomic changes around the same time that disproportionately impacted industries employing lots of women?

/edit

they cite a survey by localcircles but the actual data is nowhere to be found; the best i could get is [this article](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/small-cos-hire-fewer-women-to-save-maternity-costs/74541809) reporting on the survey, which says

>nearly half of early stage startups and small businesses in a survey said they have hired fewer or no women in the last 12 months, citing the higher cost of complying with the government’s six-month paid maternity leave policy.

now that would be pretty definitive, however i am not confident that the survey was structured so as to allow respondents to 'cite a reason' for increased or decreased hiring of women

>it, however, showed that about 44% of respondents wanted the current policy to stay.

anyway the original article seems to be reporting on a survey which seems to not be public. neither the design, nor the raw responses, leave alone methodology(how were respondents selected, how many did not respond etc.). that's why menstrual leave for women would not be helpful it will only increase discrimination and give another excuse for corporations to not take them for jobs. add a peternity leave and problem solved. ah yes. but even when we are single employers have questions like “you’re muslim, so why haven’t your parents gotten you married yet? how are they letting you work???” 

so who is the ideal woman in the eyes of these companies? who is the most employable? if you ever worked in a startup, you know how much is the work pressure, usually, women hardly prefer to join. they join marketing or product management. another thing, why force a cash crunch company to pay for maternity? equality doesn't work if you shove everything in our throats. if the startup succeeds, it can create many jobs. 

women leave the workforce because of family commitment, they do that in western countries too. you just can't keep your family happy and have a successful professional life. it's easy to blame the employer and say how sexist they are when it comes to hiring. but think about it - a bootstrapped startup that has a hand to mouth existence cannot simply afford paying salaries to its employees when they are not working - that too, for six months at a stretch. 

the government cannot wash its hands off by simply announcing six months maternity for women. they should also bear the cost; at least partly for the women who do avail the break. if you want companies to hire despite potentially losing an employee for an extended period, at least provide them with incentives that will soften the blow. people in india think having one negligent parent, and one attentive parent is a good thing for a child.

my mother had to prove to her bosses that she could function with a womb. my dad didn’t. guess which parent spent more time with me when i was growing up. and which one was promoted more. i know this sounds sexist but rarely have i enjoyed working with women. there's just so much drama and stress over petty issues. although this is just my experience and it can vary amongst different fields.

with regards to startups, they simply cannot afford paying maternity leave unless the government compensates for it (by reducing taxes or something). k", shahofblah fplrocks san-iwl- ninjabillii hatabhaga Froogler rebelioustomboy 77-q5 None,almost half startups don t hire women save maternity costs roughly 40 women complete higher education join workforce drop within decade family commitments

this is like those other clickbait headlines where they compare gdps and billionaire wealth. the rich keep on getting richer and the poor are getting more poorer. interesting to see people want to tax the rich 50%. coz that can’t go wrong, hand over more money to the corrupt government. banana republic all you retards don't even know that most of this wealth is in the stock price of their companies.

if they sell, the price crashes and so does the ""wealth"".

***lock – on means 'disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

we never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. while the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. the lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. if you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

this pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** how prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. talking about investments, the fds, stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. the alternate investment options like sips, mutual funds too aren’t performing. 

remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is home**. a sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. it is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

a critical question arising out of the covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and real estate post the lockdown?**

studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. however, as said by benjamin franklin, “out of adversity comes opportunity”. the sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to invest in real estate, against all the current odds. 

real estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**why will the indian real estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. the world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of india and china, according to a latest un trade report.

2. the virus pushes u.s.-chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent u.s.-chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. this rift will lead india to gain interests of global investors and companies. these investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. these factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in india.

3. china lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of covid 19 to the world. after china, india is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. india so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. indian real estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a nation full of values and ethics, leading india with great avenues to become a global superpower.

5. nri investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst rupee fall.

while the above conditions make india a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **emotional investment**: in india, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. the sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. interestingly, after our first name, ‘home’ is second most used word in the world every day. ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the world will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**statistics:** the indian real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be usd 650 bn by 2025 and usd 1,000 bn by 2030. residential, commercial and retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. real estate contributed nearly 6% to india’s gdp in 2017. as per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of india’s gdp by 2025.

· **real estate – largest employment generator:** after agriculture, real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **india’s real estate employee base is estimated to be 67 mn by 2022.**

· **high tangible asset value:** real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **competitive risk- adjustment returns :** based on july 2018 data from national council of real estate investment fiduciaries **(ncreif),** private market **commercial real estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** this credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **attractive and stable income return (specially in commercial space):** the **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. commercial investment can yield upto 12% roi and lowest to 5% roi (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **inflation hedging:** the inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between gdp growth and demand for real estate. as economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **long term “assured” wealth building asset with “predictable “ returns and least risk** :- real estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of regular **“predictable” returns (yield is higher than dividend returns) and an “assured” capital appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of corporate scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“helps you raise money quickly”** \- **hard asset is the most preferred collateral for a bank**, to raise capital through a loan (lap/lrd) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **the ever rising fsi benefit** \- **“wine and real estate improve with age”** \- while as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing fsi norms of mmr the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of real estate in central mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **work from home culture:** we are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. we expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. so commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **student housing:** an unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in india. real estate consultancy firm, anarock property consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in india, more than 75% live away from home. existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. developers in mumbai & pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **co-living market** size across india’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. the demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a cushman & wakefield india report.

· **reits are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. unlike other equity investments, reits provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. reits are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. there is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. india's first listed reit, has gained 50% since listing in march 2019 as against a 10% gain in the nifty realty index and 5% return of the benchmark nifty 50.

· india’s improved rank on **ease of doing business** and the courage to implement reforms such as demo, rera, and ibc are indeed creditworthy. these are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**why real estate during lockdown?**

probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. here is why –**

1. **reduction in home loan rates:** on 27 march 2020, the reserve bank of india (rbi) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). the reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. new home loan rates start at 8% from 1 march 2020. so indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **low demand – value for money:** real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by developers. to maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. end-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **reduction in stamp duty:** the maharashtra government on march 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for mumbai, mmrda region and pune for a period of two years.

4. **passive income:** various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. this is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **demand- supply breakthrough:** due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. but once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. the rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **segment shift** : earlier lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 lakh property. now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **strike the iron when it is hot:** we all must have heard this at least once. but it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some developers is as high as 15-18%.

**final thoughts:** 

**your money is safe in indian real estate**

\- regulator like maharera leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- high court judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- nclt giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- the supreme court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**the bottom line**

**real estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , it is about the safest investment in the world.**

real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. on its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. real estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“buy real estate in areas where the path exists , and buy more real estate where there is no path, but you can create your own. don’t wait to buy real estate , buy real estate and wait.**

buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. real estate shoule be the last thing one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the emi of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
i'm




2. houses are highly illiquid investments. with the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. if there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. there will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

so expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


a large number of real estate firms will wind up. quite a few will be stuck in litigation . you money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset.

i am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - i have been offered a base salary and along with that i get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. for house allowance - do i have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? or do i have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. do i have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. how do i claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

basically trying to understand how much i can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account

thanks!",moving back to india - salary breakdown question,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ft2tfm/moving_back_to_india_salary_breakdown_question/," > for house allowance - do i have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? or do i have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?

&#x200b;

let's assume your hra component is 3 lakhs. at the start of the financial year/ whenever you join a new company, you need to declare what you expect to pay as rent. for example, you may say your rent is 20000 \* 12 months = 2.4 lakhs. 

the company will pay you the entire hra amount every month (3 lakh/ 12 months = 25000/ per month.) but since you declared rent of 20k only the company will consider only 20k as tax exempt and the will deduct tax on the remaining 5k.

(there are some other rules around how much hra is tax exempt, google it to know more.)

if you declare that you pay no rent, you will get 25k minus whatever tax slab you fall in.

if you declare your rent as exactly 25k, you will get the whole amount. but near the end of the financial year, your company will ask for proof of rent. you will need to submit rent receipts signed by your landlord along with his pan number. if you do manage submit the receipts, then everything is great. 

if you don't the company will consider your entire hra component as taxable, and deduct tax from that month's salary in one go. which is why it is better to be as realistic/ truthful as possible, else you might find yourself getting a fraction of your salary during the last month of the fy.

so to answer your question, the hra money is paid to you, the only thing is how much tax is deducted before it is paid out.

&#x200b;

>do i have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?

&#x200b;

i assume that the 'special allowance' you refer to is is the component over and above your basic + hra. if yes, then you don't need to do anything to claim it. it will be paid to you every month minus tax.

&#x200b;

>how do i claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

&#x200b;

not sure what you mean by vehicle allowance. 

if by internet allowance you mean the telephone reimbursement then the process is this - every month/ quarter, your company will ask you to submit your telephone bills. if you do submit the bills, you will get the reimbursement along with your salary - this is tax exempt till the amount of bills you submit. 

&#x200b;

if you don't submit any bills, you will get the amount as a lumpsum at the end of the year, minus tax. (this is what i've usually seen) imo, indian companies break-up salaries into different components in order to:


1- compute taxes easily, and 

2- to minimise some costs like pf, gratuity, etc. 

since u/georgecostanza9 has already explained point 1 in detail, i’ll explain the second.

the indian provident fund (pf) rules dictate that *12%* of your *basic pay* will be deducted and paid into a sort of account maintained by the government. this money currently earns an interest of about 7% (down from over 8% last year).

in addition to your 12%, the company also is required to contribute an equal/equivalent amount, which is also deposited with the government as part of your pf. this component may be detailed in your salary as 'employer‘s pf contribution'. note: this so called contribution from your employer will not be paid to you, and should therefore not be included in computing the amount you’d receive at the end of the month.

now, in order to pay a smaller 'employer’s contribution', companies tend to offer a smaller salary component called 'base salary/pay'. 

if the other ‘allowances' were to be included as part of one inclusive salary package, both yours’ and the company’s 12% pf deduction/contribution would e higher. for a simpler calculation... if your salary is above 20l then you get between 20-25% deducted as tax and other prerequisites.. so about 75-80% will come as in hand every month... from the tax components... you need to put it in various schemes and et all to save on tax... so that's a hassle i dont think a new person wants to get into esp since the 1.5 lakh limit gets very easily exhausted and the hra exempt is on actuals... so unless you have a home loan on your account.. you dont have much you can do there
on the 75% ish you get in hand..  will be what you get paid and is post tax..  so if you are getting paid x annually..  a simplest tool is to do (x/12)*75% as your actual in hand salary... on the conservative side
let me know if you need any help with the specifics", georgecostanza9 WebCram _rmbler,moving back salary breakdown question hi all came us masters worked years planning move back soon offered job role first job basic questions bit confused allowances offer breakdown offered base salary along house rent allowance special allowance vehicle reimbursement internet allowance house allowance submit rental agreement employer claim submit someone else e filing taxes end year deposited part salary month directly given landlord 2 anything claim special allowance automatically deposited account along base salary 3 claim vehicle internet allowance similar housing allowance comes part salary go companies directly basically trying understand much expect salary deposit account thanks

a) investors and their risk premiums - right away, you can expect companies and investors hoarding cash and trying to not have riskier investments. therefore, a production facility in india will not make roi sense right away

now here's where i am getting a bit uneasy, because the company name is say abc, but when i research it, the company logo is different. also, the email i received has an address that does not match the name of the company.


it's a pretty big company btw, like accenture or capgemini. so i just wanted to ask, is it usual for companies to use email ids like these, or is it an offshoring mediator, or a scam?",scam or not?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu34t7/scam_or_not/," it looks like a scam. they will probably give you a ludicrous offer and then say you need to some amount as registration fees. be wary of it. nope. if email id is different i'd say these are imposters.

but it is lock down time, call em up and pass the time , disconnect the call if they ask for money not usual. big companies will make you run for a month before scheduling a written exam and interview after that. talking about companies like accentuate and infosys. looks like a scam. most of companies have stopped hiring for the moment and they got back to you in just a day: too good to be true.

and those mncs provide company email ids to their employees, like xyz@tcs.com if it indeed is a scam they will ask you to pay a ""processing fee"" after the interview which of course you shouldn't. sometimes big companies at least in my sector (oil and gas) recruit through 3rd party agencies so it's highly dependent on the sector. but usually these third party agencies are very professional and will be very transparent. if its for an offshore deployment they will in rare instances seek payments from you as visa and medical consultation fees after you get the offer, visas and travel tickets. don't pay anything.", Fabulous-Rice harinotharry Android5511 Tastypizzzza 51837 msan123456 namanjha29,scam not hi applied job yesterday got invitation telephonic interview here getting bit uneasy company name say abc research company logo different email received address match name company pretty big company btw accenture capgemini wanted ask usual companies use email ids these offshoring mediator scam
hardeepnarang10,2020-01-17,Business/Finance,129,395,False,,amazon india today's landing page,https://i.redd.it/xnwbxzf15ab41.jpg," 1. amazon is amazing for small sellers looking for a platform to find customers and a system to deliver products to them.
2. jeff bezos is the richest person in the history of humanity and is looking to get even richer. managing to monopolise e-commerce in india will increase his net-worth exponentially.

both 1. and 2. can be true at the same time. arguably, 2 will probably outlive 1. while we can acknowledge amazon for providing a vital infrastructure that out state has simply failed to provide without private means, that's no reason to do puja of bezos.  

i recently ordered achaar from amazon. later i received the call from the seller. it was a lady, who said she was a seller from rohtak and that her mom was preparing the achaar and hoped that we would love it.

now i am ordering achaar from rohtak sitting in hyderabad. a lady sitting in rohtak is able to start her own business and find sellers across india. now amazon is not perfect and it may have hundred of issues. but small things like this make me believe they are making a positive change. can the current govt say they are doing the same? out of all shows bezos mentioned mirzapur, so he must have watched it.

heck with the bargaining and haggling with the retailers. amazon has never disappointed me with their service and delivery, and i have been buying stuffs from them ever since they entered india. their customer support is simply terrific. lot of small shopkeepers don’t get sale due to amazon but the question is if it is correct or wrong nobody can answer but as a consumer it always benefit if they get product at small price than shop also many items i don’t get from small shop i see and buy from amazon so it is beneficial for consumers jeff has a monopoly but it's really good. i currently live in the us and amazon as a platform scares me with its scale. it is like a parallel government with huge sophisticated systems of delivery that push their workers to the extreme.

it is fascinating, no doubt - and it wouldn't be this successful if it wasn't good for both the consumers and the sellers - but it is a monopoly. it should have been broken down years ago into smaller companies but i am assuming that it is now too big to do that. [removed] what they forgot to mention is the millions of jobs lost due to their steep discounts. i don’t understand how amazon is good for india, they claim to spend 1billion and in the end they will profit 10billion and steal from the economy. simple math why anyone does business.", MrAC_4891 try2tame BornOn1stJan wamov bitterpopsicle choicelesspawn kirk7899 totoropoko None TendarCoconut None,amazon today landing page

freewheelin_zee,2020-03-24,Business/Finance,9,13,False,"**tl;dr owner of a bank or financial institute can change the amount of money in the financial system (modern money is just a number in the banks database), while manipulation of this nature is impossible on block chain**

**given the current indian financial market situation me and a friend had this dialogue to try and understand if bitcoin is of any use to us.. may be it helps you start a conversation with someone else and get a better understanding of things.**  

i’m a stock market trader and recently i was talking to this friend of mine who is into bitcoin as  well as the stock market.. 

he asked me if i knew why bitcoin was needed in this world.. 

and my answer was.. an alternate currency

turns out it’s got an actual reason for existing

**btc is an alternative to fiat currency? or “store of value” like how gold is?**

but bitcoin is not like gold at all. 

* gold is valuable as a metal. 
* it is soft, malleable, 
* very good conductor of electricity, 
* safe to the skin unlike copper and does not tarnish over time. 
* if we needed gold in large quantities and cost wasn’t a problem, we can actually create gold in particle accelerators. so it's not a matter of gold being scarce

**bitcoin has no physical value like gold. bitcoin is all digital.**

&#x200b;

**a simple though experiment:**

let’s assume i open a bank called dvz bank and people have deposited a total of rs.1,000 with my bank. 

* now people and corporations come to me asking for loans and i give them a combined loan of rs. 10,000. 

where did the extra rs.9,000 come from? 

you decide whether this is a problem or not for a financial system.

**as it turns out, in the modern world, money is just a number in a bank's software. it can be tweaked any way the controlling authorities want.**

as an authority, without a few people in my pocket, i  could set up a xyz business just for the purpose of creating money. xyz business would never make a single rupee in profit but we will keep adding new money into the xyzs bank account every month. it's our bank. our software. our database. who is to stop us? 

whereas blockchain is a self-regulating database. 

**once an entry is made into the blockchain, it can not be edited without destroying the whole database. it maintains integrity by nature.** 

**so, if 21 million bitcoins are coded into the database, it cannot ever become 22 million bitcoins. whereas in any other currency or banking platform it can be changed.** 

banks are based on ledgers that can be manipulated by the bank owners and governing parties. 

bitcoin runs on blockchain ledgers which are immutable.

to break this down ever further, let’s say you have 100 rupees in paytm wallet and paytm’s core developer is your best friend. you can convince him to turn that 100 into 10,000. this cannot be done with bitcoin, if that is done, the whole database breaks.

has this ever happened? paytm has been accused of internal fraud by audit companies multiple times. a famous incident that can be quickly searched online is where an ex paytm employee created fake transactions in order to earn from cashbacks. total fraud of over 10cr. 

the loans given out in bitcoins will be real bitcoins and not fake money which eventually turns into real money. banks give out money that they don’t have and don't recover, that leaves a hole in the financial system.

blockchain is attempting to provide a very clean and efficient financial system, to have a record of what’s coming in and what’s going out. if implemented successfully, we will do away with printing money and bringing in helicopter money during times like these. it will all be a zero-sum game then.

your thoughts in comments please (we are figuring this out through a dialogue so please be constructive with the comments, in a way that we learn a thing a two from your comments too)

**negatives of block chain/bitcoin** 

we came across some negatives for bitcoin too.

if country has trillion $ economy.. and it gets burned..by some natural calamity or some other factor

no problem, govt will pump in another trillion into existence and live on.

but if i have million bitcoins and lose the key

it’s gone forever. no chance of ever recovering it",a dialogue for indians to understand why bitcoin even exists,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo4779/a_dialogue_for_indians_to_understand_why_bitcoin/," you do know that bitcoin prices are also manipulated by  the super rich as they obviously hold the largest stash there was first gold..

then there was $,

$ was accumulated and used against gold

then the world started using $ instead of gold

&#x200b;

and then the $ was taken off the gold standard

&#x200b;

while i'm not saying that blockchain will follow the same trajectory..

it does have the potential to. and it can take years.. or even decades to reach where blockchain is used for all majority transactions there are many shortcomings of blockchain actually

ringtring,2020-04-05,Policy/Economy,64,389,False,"hi there!

as is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the centre to the states. here is a representative news report: [""centre grants rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the union's contribution to the ""state disaster response mitigation funds (sdrmfs)"" and the rest is as a ""revenue deficit grant"".

**tl;dr:** the short answer on why delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the fifteenth finance commission (xv-fc) has not included delhi in its recommendations. this is because delhi is not a state. the finance commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the union government and state governments.

**deep dive:**

the xv-fc recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at union (ndrmf) and state levels (sdrmfs).

these new funds are distinct from the o.g. 😎 'national disaster response fund' (ndrf) and sdrfs under the disaster management act, 2005. the ndrf and srdfs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

the ndrmf and sdrmf are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the union and state governments.

*note 1*: the difference here lies in the words **response** (ndrf/sdrf) and **mitigation** (ndrmf/sdrmf). mitigation is pre-disaster. mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*note 2*: the ndrmf/sdrmf are statutory (legal) funds under the disaster management act, 2005 📝. just like the ndrf and sdrfs.

*note 3*: the supreme court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund (ndmf) and state sdmfs. this was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. this direction was not followed by most governments in india, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of revenue-deficit grants are only for state governments.

source: 15th finance commission report 2020-21. pages 34, 35, 55, 56, and 99. [accessible here](https://fincomindia.nic.in/writereaddata/html_en_files/oldcommission_html/fincom15/xvfc_202021%20report_english_web.pdf), at the finance commission's website.

**edit and update:** it seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. the union’s devolution under the xv-fc’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the coronavirus epidemic. it also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the government of delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. some possible financing mechanisms that i’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* further union contributions to delhi’s sdrf (most effective)
* making funds available from the union home affairs ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* ways and means advances from rbi (30 day credit limit)
* union spending through new delhi municipal corporation (limited geographical spread)

i think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by xv-fc in allocation of state share of sdrmf funds. people critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. this will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. you can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. we all know the *real* reason why delhi got 0. >the short answer on why delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the fifteenth finance commission (xv-fc) has not included delhi  in its recommendations. this is because delhi is not a state.

yes so delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like ndrf or the pm relief fund. i'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco leave all technicalities. can someone tell me how is delhi supposed to operate without this fund? basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? great post u/ringtring. kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why delhi was not allocated funds.

either kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against aap by the centre. either way, he needs to get his facts right. nice research with finance commission recommendations.

but the recommendations of the fc is advisory and hence not binding on the govt. . so nothing like constitutional obligations. 

also pm cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so i feel the ball is in central govt. court now to get funds for delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. i think kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.

http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=finance_commission this just sounds like bullshit based on limited understanding on so many levels. let me tell you a few reasons why this simply cannot be true:

1) let's say the disaster was limited to delhi. would they still give money to everyone - all states but delhi? of course not, they would have given money only to delhi in that case. it's truly absurd to think that the centre is restricted from handing out funds to delhi government in case of an emergency.

2) the money may not come out of sdmf but could come out of any number of places including but definitely not limited to the pmnrf or pm cares fund. if you are saying that it is simply not possible for centre to hand out money to delhi government to deal with covid-19, that's simply absurd.

3) delhi is going to get money sooner or later of this doesn't get better. it's only a matter of time. and the question would be why were they not given the money sooner, like the other states. 

4) at the end of the day what matters is that money that comes to the delhi government, not the  route that it follows. it's a job of the centre to figure out the route and they are definitely not ""helpless"" in not giving money to delhi. if they wanted to, delhi would have had the money by now. what nonsense. let me get the timeline straight.

bjp 2014: elect us delhi, we will give you statehood.

bjp 2015: elect us delhi, we will give you statehood.

aap 2015-2019: give us statehood.

bjp: no.

aap 2020: give us money for tackling a pandemic like every other state.

bjp: sorry, you are not a state.

the government should stay out of bailing out highly leveraged companies which go bust due to the pandemic.

it is the equivalent of bailing out an individual borrowing money from a bank to invest in the stock market and losing all of it in the crash.

it misallocates resources by saving companies in which the government has vested interests. https://youtu.be/nggh7wktdh4

venture capital ceo dumbfounds cnbc anchor by saying billionaires and hedge funds don’t deserve a bailout: ‘let them get wiped out!’ they are demanding this after eating the 1.7lac crore tax subsidy. *maane, paisa poora apna hi hai* til about lemon socialism pay 1 crore in pm cares and get 100s of crore in bailout we don't want private profits and socialized losses.

if companies can't save for rainy day or emergencies, then they don't deserve to be in business. let them fail and more competent people can buy the assets and turnaround the company. i think an appropriate response from the government can be what many people like shamika ravi have suggested. a 6 month tax holiday for all companies from 1 apr 20 to 30 sep 20. it helps all companies (and not just big or publicly listed companies) to the extent of their size.

and it's the least costly from administrative purposes, easiest to implement. and the government can focus on the health aspects of the pandemic.

if needed it can also be extended, and tax holiday benefits everyone proportionally to their size. the goi barely has any money to provide food to the populace.

hiranandanis and adanis can get fucked.

india is not the us where the federal reserve can print unlimited money and it doesn't matter one bit. to be fair it's not as if there's been some wrong doing by these companies who are adversely affected by the pandemic. there's been a government order forbidding them from functioning (not that the order is in anyway wrong) and that's why a majority of these companies are in trouble. you can't simultaneously force them to die and then criticise them for dying. i love how we have brought this 'capitalism socialism' debate virus from america. as if there were not enough differences of opinion, now we have to deal with another. wow. > people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public,” wrote adam smith in book 1, chapter 10 of the wealth of nations. smith is an economist who is oft quoted and rarely read these days

ParmanuMan,2020-04-08,Policy/Economy,42,389,False,"if other countries start behaving like india , then they will ban the exports of ventilators, ppe , masks and other things to india from their nations . india doesn't have the capacity to make any of them . should they behave like that too ?

we don't have the capacity to manufacture ventilators . we import them .

we don't have the capacity to manufacture the high grade ppe required for this pandemic . the local manufacturers need machines from foreign nations to make it . hence we have to import them too 

we don't have the capacity to make advanced drugs . india mostly makes generic medicines . hence we need to import them too .

now think of the pain and hardship if other nations retaliate against india and ban the exports of above mentioned items to india as tit-for-tat move for our ban on export of hcq to them .

people need to stop with their kneejerk and short term style of thinking


usa and europe already have a shortage of ventilators and masks . despite that they haven't forced their companies in any way to not sell to foreign nations . in fact when trump tried to do that in usa against canada , he was shat on by everyone and given the middle finger . 

however , if india goes ahead with ban on medicine exporters , then trump will be proven correct and his standing will be strengthened.

what is your plan if people in canada , usa , germany , uk etc start acting like india and ban exports of ventilators ,ppe etc ? they aren't doing that right now","to people who are demanding the ban on export of medicines from india to other nations , have you given any thoughts to what will happen if other nations ban the export of things we need ( ventilators , ppe , masks , advanced medicines )",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx7ref/to_people_who_are_demanding_the_ban_on_export_of/," let’s give them the stuff on a humanitarian basis but make it clear that india will not tolerate such rhetoric. the call isn’t to stop exports but to be vocal against such bullying. we die [removed] i think one of the reason why people are demanding a ban on hcq is the uncertainty towards the availability of hcq for indians at this crucial times. ofcourse, it's stupid to think profit/being selfish here but its no brainer to understand the consequences if there's a shortage of the drug in the country. we never know how this pandemic thingy will end in india.  

as far as ppe and ventilators are concerned some psus have started making it already. gwalior drde is manufacturing 200k masks each week whereas drdo is using an adhesive which is used to build suits for paratrooper, to make ppes/hazmat suits. they are likely to produce around 15-20k ppes every week. 

baboon on  the other hand gave a clear indications of retaliation incase of a ban. i heard india already agreed to export hcq to neighboring countries including us. thing is, no one is against exports. but first, we need to think of our people. imperialist countries like usa will pressure or force other counties for their interests. we don't need to bow down to compromise for our people's lives. no one will give us ventilators or ppe if there is shortage in their countries. india should be able to manufacture the majority of the ppe, drugs, etc. that she currently depends on other nations for. i especially believe this given india's large population. morarji desai had the right idea about fostering indigenous business in order to ensure self-reliance.

this is not a direct response to your post. i agree, actually. we should treat others the way we expect to be treated. but, with our large population, supposed rapid rate of development, etc. we really should be able to make all these things. just another reason i find much of india's ""progress"" to be bogus. bhakts: boycott chinese goods

goi: we have imported ppes from china as we messed up on getting our ppe requirements in the tender sent out and who rapped us on our knuckles for that we should give help on humanitarian basis but are we? are we really doing that? 

we only gave hcq only because we were bullied. if we wanted to give it on humanitarian basis we wouldn't have imposed the ban on the first place.

we won't see ventilators until the first world has enough of them. most of people i spoke with think india ""invented"" those medicines and has absolute control over the intellectual property and production. what a shitfest, india should and have to provide these generics as and when needed, part law part business commitments am curious. many states have. china was donated ppe and ventilator from india and other countries (italy included).  

but seeing that it's charging italy to get back its own donations, leave alone fresh ones are going to hard to get.. and then it's the quality control issues with many states netherlands and finland including highlighting issues.

usa is actively cornering the market on ppe and ventilators, hijacking domestic orders and out bidding on international ones.

so good idea, but if this continues the only ppe and ventilators available will be the domestic ones. 

countries are increasingly fighting for drugs and ppe and ventilators. so at the very least sending supplies to other countries must be after ensuring domestic supplies or getting a proper quid pro quo.. also this as well

yet minister of state of finance anurag thakur says ""no impact on economy"". nirmala doesn't care as she doesn't invest in stocks. modi is fakir aadmi. unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts.

not only has yes bank failed but with supreme court order on vodafone agr dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of npas on top banks, including sbi and indusind. it wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

moreover vodafone a large international company failing due to goi greed will be death knell of foreign investments into india. imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. this govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

even liquid funds are crashing hard as even goi defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. lot of rbi money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by demo, gst, saving private banks, etc. while other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to indian citizens.


during recession, you need actual economists like manmohan singh and raghuram rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like anurag thakur and nirmala tai.

all of them. it's a cult. there is no reasoning with a cult. they will cut their own balls and hand it do modi in a gold vessel to show their loyalty. 

it's just sane idiots like us who will die screaming at his/her own misfortune to be alive to see a rising country being pulled down to the rubbles. now that corona virus is there to take all the blame, otherwise we would have had a 5-trillion economy before 2024 ! 2020s are going to be a completely lost decade for india. we'll be lucky to get out of lower middle income status. the sad thing is the govt will piggyback on the corona virus reason for the next 3 years for all the economic downturn- and trust me bhakts will buy it. i follow indian markets for work and stuff.
your govt has been giving tax benefits and stuff to the stock markets for some years now at the cost of a deficit budget.

now in the face of a pandemic, things are go to shit.

knowing politicos as they are, they will probably put up a smokescreen and try to distract over some useless stuff.

the only thing india has going for it roght now economically is that the crude oil has crashed while domestic rates have still been kept up through taxes which should help their budget

edit: oh yeah and i forgot about the gst and demonitizibg debacle. that threw a cog in your machine too i believe it's a feature not a bug. desperate insecure people are easier to manipulate and brainwashed towards blaming their misfortunes on whoever govt wants - minorities, migrants, opposition, etc. clueless and arrogant. that's the deadly combination out to destroy our economy and our lives. there is no 3d or 4d chess with this administration headed by modikaka. they are incompetent, incoherent and incapable. bhakts will not change. source, my bf is bhakt and even after all this, he is still supporting bjp. i am damn sure , once this corona gets over , they will plan to build some big god figure statue to thank on how it saved us from corona.. and waste more money

JiskiLathi,2020-03-22,Policy/Economy,48,420,False,"counties around the world are taking huge steps to help their industries, like offering billions of dollars of packages to their companies, delaying tax deadlines/loan repayment dates etc. industries have come to a standstill, with malls, restaurants, hotels, tourism all affected and more or less shut down due to the spread of coronavirus. 

however indian fm is doing nothing useful, [but instead asking companies to file corona readiness report](https://theprint.in/economy/modi-govt-asks-firms-to-submit-form-on-covid-19-readiness-cas-say-this-is-not-the-time/384863/)

nirmala has not spoken a work about postponing upcoming tax deadlines, waiving off gst fines, announcing packages to help industries etc. many cas have been asking fm to take these steps but she has as usual been silent as a worm. 

nirmala sitharaman and anurag thakur together form the most clueless team to head finance portfolio in our country ever. now they have belatedly formed ""corona task force"" and nirmala has already said ""any relief packages will take time"" when lots of countries have already announced packages","nirmala is asking companies to file ""corona readiness"" report, instead of giving them financial packages, delaying gst deadline, etc. such a useless finance minister",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmsoix/nirmala_is_asking_companies_to_file_corona/," india gormint response to everything: pls to fill this form, get seal, take xerox, come back , stand in queue, give 30 bucks to get token, stand in queue to then submit it online and then stand in queue to get some babu's seal and a later date appointment. and the worst finance minister of all time award goes to...
mrs. nirmala sitarman pointless exercise. this is their way or washing their hands off any responsibility. this form achieves absolutely nothing.

""oh, the whole nation is having a crisis and is on the verge of a recession? here fill this form."" indian bureaucracy at its finest. easiest thing to do is get plans from everyone instead of preparing one plan. also what about no-corporate class. she only looks at corporate, that's minority in india as long as our govt. maintains the same stance, we’re in for a ride for recession. keep some savings in cash with you until we recover, guys.

otoh, giving away care packages in billions dollars or trillions of dollars to fix the economy like us is doing will lead to inflation. if this happens or is announced, keep savings in gold. 

neither the us nor especially india can afford giving away so much money without printing money when there’s no income or govt. savings. we do have huge foreign exchange reserves,  but it’s best we leave it for the aftermath of covid19. the us might be able to get away with giving away care packages since investors started pulling 100s of billions of dollars from every market and back into us bonds(why the dollar strengthened relative to every major currency). 

so yeah, if substantial care packages or tax reliefs are announced here for the long run, gold investments it is. just saying as an sme business-owner who literally cannot be prepared for corona because wfh is literally impossible in my nature of business activities.

this is supposed to be a peak season for us because eid is upcoming and there is huge demand in bangladesh and west bengal for what we sell.

if i was selling approx. goods worth 10 lakhs per day (b2b) across all my branches, the volumes have literally crashed to 1 lakh per day. i can only imagine how much worse it must be for my suppliers. lol! 
i must one of very few idiots to have filed my gst return on time...

when it was slow time during second week of feb, i managed to file everything without a hitch.

the fact is you can't escape this shit and as small time business man, i have to do it myself and on time. 

so, instead of bitching about it, i do it promptly month after month before deadline and every time i do, i curse these fuckers-in-charge who put additional burden on already stressed sme to a breaking point.

i hope there is a special kind of hell planned for these bastards who harass the law abiding tax paying citizens and let aliya-maliya enjoy their wicked gains.

sorry for big rant but that's just my frustrations talking.

regards. giving billions of dollars to companies never helped anyone. just look at the example of us after 2008 recession. it's better to give money to people directly. what's wrong with that?

my mofo manager is hiding at home, says he is on personal leave and i'm working alone in office. just because these assholes don't want to get billed for 2k per month for laptops.

## tl;dr

with a view to address the public health challenges due to covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. we at iff have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in india.  this includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

we devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications singapore’s tracetogether, mit’s private kit : safe path’s project and aarogya setu. we also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between apple and google towards contact tracing.  to conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the indian supreme court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. it's possible if we try!

## re-framing the privacy and public health trade-off

the world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. a reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the covid-19 pandemic. in these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

however, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. this prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. at the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the covid virus. one such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the aarogya setu app by the government of india.

recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by covid. this must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## overview of the working paper

this [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndopzygqyteteguolzula5o9y5f3f5yjdsa2pd99o6u/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. the first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. we have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. all three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. this can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. to illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications singapore’s tracetogether, mit’s private kit : safe path’s project and aarogya setu (pages 59-73) in section 7. we also look at the apple-google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. it is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in india with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the covid-19 pandemic.”

## we have three primary objectives from this working paper

*a comprehensive map on covid technology interventions:* our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. this is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. we have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in india.

*breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. these are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. we hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*collaborative solutions for government:* we don't have all the answers. but, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to government authorities. to facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndopzygqyteteguolzula5o9y5f3f5yjdsa2pd99o6u/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. in addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**internet freedom forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## what does iff plan to do with this working paper?

we will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. so for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. this will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

this working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. for instance we have already filed rtis to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. more action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

i am doing nothing special for coronavirus suppression but i have provided essential goods on credit to the people i know and i have not raised my prices unnecessarily.

i have some potatoes grown on my own land and those were stored for my own consumption but i would sell them at sustainable price if need arises.

i have no hand sanitizer, only soaps which i am not hoarding.

i am not a rich man but i am trying my best to help out the people in this situation. the problem started with educated people not taking precautions and practicing social distancing and isolation for atleast a week so that it would be confirmed that they had no symptoms.

now the next wave will start when poor people who can't deal with price rise of essential commodities and zero income and who are unknowingly infected rush to their villages.

even if they are locked down,who will supply them essentials?

more than money the poor right now need sanitised living conditions and food.

with summer coming soon only the almighty can help us stop the spread and even if a vaccine were to come today, it would take time for everyone to be cured why wait for billionairs and millionairs to step in each one of us can do what we can we have decided our maid and cook to stay and home and their months salary will be paid. each one step up and do your part. spot on. spend a moment thinking of the plight of daily-wage-earners too it's been 13,599 deaths due to corona virus and everyone has lost their minds. because kanika kapoors are also affected by it.  

36 million people will die due to hunger this year and no one will bat an eyelash over it. i have a string feeling that lockdown announced was planned.

govt tried jutna curfew so that there is no panic among the masses. people thinking, movement will be allowed from monday.

hence they announce lockdown in the evening. it's happening right now, \~.\~

that's how you distract people when you have no knowledge a day will come when india's billionaires and millionaires will **feel the bern!** ask people to put on a show, they will gladly do that. ask them to follow precautions, nahhhh....... this. a lot of people are going to die because of the economic impact of corona virus. the lockdown means less opportunity for the poor people who barely get by with their current earnings. i never felt this much frustrated in my entire life. literally, everyone in my society was doing this shit thinking, clapping will make covid disappear.", iamsosorryiloveyou Spideyocd anivartin moha_n muhammad_sitaram namanjha29 apple_pie_nlue_pie Johnathan_Johnson Shloeb dogef1 xataari,waging war corona forget economically weaker sections go everyday meal

ajayshinde74,2020-01-28,Policy/Economy,310,2616,False,,"all indians are equal, but some are greater than others - by sanitarypanels",https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOytNvOUEAEdGoM.jpg," seriously, wealth and budget and are entirely different things. the budget can never ever exceed the wealth of billionaires or in fact the cumulative wealth of all citizens as well.

budget is only the government consumption and revenue nothing else. this is a stupid comparison.


budget is every year. wealth is a one-time thing if you use all of it once you don't have anything next year.


i'm not saying there is huge no inequality in india. these kinds of misinformation does more harm than good. the us budget is 3.8 trillion, while their wealth of millionaires is 4-5 trillion. just for comparison. can provide links/working upon request. this is what happens when someone who doesn't understand the difference between a flow and a stock tries to be cool. wealth is a stock, represents a quantity at that point of time and budget is a flow, measured per year.

also what a stupid title by op. if accumulating wealth is that easy, kamake dikhao. this country will progress when people stop ""muh rich bad"" ""capitalism izz evil"". yes, there's high income inequality to address, but blaming the croporates/rich isn't the solution the richest 20 billionaires in america have a combined net worth of $732 billion. that’s more than the bottom half of the american population, or 152 million people

so what's the point, there are country with even less number and more money with them. more socialism will solve india's problems. sure. i can never understand nonsense like this. what do they want? a totalitarian communist state where everyone has the same money irrespective of the work they do?

here's the deal. human society in 2020 is structured in a way that different people perform different roles. we all influence each other and we wouldn't be able to continue without that. therefore, our interactions are monetized in a way that people who influence more people positively, make more money.

this is a good thing. for all the shit that idealists throw at it, free market capitalism is one of the best inventions of the 20th century. and it is absolutely fair.

communism essentially says this. you are born and you immediately deserve the same thing as everyone.

capitalism says, you are born and you will get value, equivalent to the amount of goods and services you give to someone else.

the former may ""seem"" fair, but it isn't.

the bajaj family for instance, has almost 10 billion in wealth. they have this because the products and services they have built, influences that many individuals. it doesn't make any sense to posit that they don't deserve that money. they didn't steal  my money. they didn't hurt anyone. they sold a lot of vehicles. 

and this is just their net worth. a lot of that is in terms of assets like buildings and factories, which actually help other individuals by providing work opportunity.

if we actually want a society where there is less disparity, we need to think about giving more people more opportunities to create products and services. we should structure our taxes in such a way that a person can be born, get an education and live a healthy, free life to be able to pursue an opportunity to make their product or service available to others. that's it. 

if we go beyond that and look at the rich as some sort of evil person stealing our rightful money, we will walk down a dangerous path. we only need to look at russia and venezuela to see the effects of that. kon hai ye chutiya op bs is this some sort of a socialist joke? 🤦🏻‍♂️ typical fallacy, where you're comparing quantities that have different units.

wealth = ₹, 
budget = ₹/t, where t is arbitrarily chosen to be one year

change t to minutes, and you might be able to conclude something else.

another nonsensical example:

2. if you opt for reduced new rate, you are not eligible to claim several tax exemptions

### tl;dr

we wrote to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs to ensure reform of india’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. we have relied on the observations made by the supreme court in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india* about gaps in the telecom suspension rules 2017 to urge for review of the rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### background

on 10 january 2020, the supreme court delivered its judgement *in anuradha bhasin v. union of india.* this case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in jammu and kashmir on 05 august 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in india’s internet shutdown framework.  the court noted that the telecom suspension rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. as a temporary stop-gap measure, the court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. first, the court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. second, the court directed the review committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like jabalpur without any publication of order.

the government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the telecom suspension rules 2017. in response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/au600.pdf), the minister of state for communications stated in rajya sabha on 06 february 2020 that the government will review the rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the supreme court’s observations. to ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs.   


### recommendations for department of telecommunications

we first wrote to the department of telecommunications under the ministry of communications on 06 february 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in india. in particular, we urged the department to commence a public consultation to review the telecom suspension rules 2017. we also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all states and union territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the supreme court in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india.*

noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. we suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the cellular operators association of india estimating that telecom operators lose rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### recommendations for ministry of parliamentary affairs

we also wrote to the ministry of parliamentary affairs on 03 april 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the minister of state for communications in rajya sabha about review of telecom suspension rules 2017. as per the government of india (allocation of business) rules, 1961, the ministry of parliamentary affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before parliament. assurances made in parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. however, in this case, the department of telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the telecom suspension rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

we recognize that due to the covid-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the telecom suspension rules 2017 must remain a priority and the parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the ministry of communications.

the indian rupee really is shitcoin and indian banks really are prisons for your meagre savings. withdrawal = transfer? why this fall from grace, i remember yes bank was once celebrated among hni's, what changed? are we going to be the next venezuela?

rbi truly hates everyone too. if you are an indian resident, you cannot hold other currencies either (very hard and most of the services are banned). bitcoin was banned until today. govt freely protect people with money in swiss bank accounts even when they have all the details about them, but thinks of ordinary citizens as biggest criminals

for a long time, indian cards didn't use to work on international websites like paypal, godaddy,.. causing you to be disconnected from the global market. i remember buying my first domain on godaddy and how impossible was to pay for it.

same with importing stuff. a lot of premium expensive items are not available in india and importing them is a horrible experience. most of the items never arrive (esp one without tracking) and if they arrive, they take at least a month or two.

indian currency is a joke. indians don't trust it, forget about the rest of the world. what's the use of the increased insurance cover of 5 lakhs for depositors announced in this budget?  does that apply only when  the bank goes bust? i'm terrified, we have nearly all of our savings in there, will this be okay by april?! or is it all gone? which would be thd next bank to take the hit ?", ShadySingh hipsydoodle harddisc None I_call_it romainmyname JagdishBhagat12khadi UtopianSoldier whycanttherebepeace snacksneaker jayroslyn,rbi imposes moratorium yes bank caps withdrawals 50 000 sources pti hindu twitter

# tl;dr

iff wrote to the jammu and kashmir government and ministry of home affairs seeking restoration of 4g internet services in kashmir during the covid 19 crisis. the region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 august 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. therefore, immediate restoration of 4g internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

# free and open internet for all

[\(screenshot of toi's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200b;

yesterday, the times of india tweeted that 4g internet services had been restored in jammu and kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. this led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of jammu and kashmir.

while the rest of india transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest covid 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2g speed in jammu and kashmir.  jammu and kashmir already has 7 confirmed covid 19 cases. with these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives.  

# dashboards and chatbots for all

while responding to the covid 19 crisis, the indian government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. take for instance, the ministry of health’s covid 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. the ministry of health and mygovindia have also collaborated with whatsapp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. even private players like apollo hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing covid 19 through a mobile app. however, the residents of jammu and kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the government is slowing down their internet speed to 2g which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# telemedicine for all

the difficulty in communicating through video on a 2g internet connection also means that doctors in jammu and kashmir cannot use telemedicine. during pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. however, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2g internet services.

healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. the essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the ministry of home affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. therefore, depriving the people of jammu and kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the government must immediately restore 4g services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

the reason for removal is not that india is suddenly considered a ""developed"" country. it's  that india has not assured the u.s. that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. hence it's justified to remove the benefits. turkey on the other hand was removed because it was considered a developed nation that does not need the benefits anymore.

a sarkari whats app what a joke how is it even related to whatsapp ? govt officials are not stupid, they have proper way of communication, they are sending copy of  budget to everyone via whatsapp. the title is misleading. please read the news before passing judgements.

gims is for government and officers. government is not replacing whatsapp. it is building a secure immediate messaging service for its administrative functions, where everything will be documented, like files in an office. clickbait what about the app launched by baba ramdev? officials are relying on whatsapp and other private messaging apps for daily information exchange.   even the sensitive ones.  
given the nature of these apps , sending highly sensitive information is very risky, 

so govt want to design a similar platform for its officials aiming at  security and keeping the data with in india. 

whatsapp and other messengers store data in their own deta centers which are not often situated in india. 

givin the techical literacy of many official,  third party apps are  too risky to transfer sensitive information you know how files mysteriously catch fire in government offices or rats eat them? those things don't happen on whatsapp or gmail because the other party always has a copy. [deleted] ""secure messaging"" just use a self hosted riot / matrix instance with federation disabled, why create a new one from scratch ? it's cute. a lot of government services still use gmail/yahoo type mail services. all government services should be using government operated email ids. but they don't. i was told that to get a new account, there is a process which takes too much time so for low priority purposes, they just get a free account and use that. 

one good example about this that comes to mind is hsvp here in haryana. here is the official list of accounts of hsvp officials: https://www.hsvphry.org.in/telephone%20list/telephone_list.pdf. it's like they are not even trying to use nic operated email accounts. 

if they think that a government operated messaging service would have much success? seems like farfetched. it should if they restrict it to actual high security officials. but in that case, it's shocking if these officials are currently relying on privately owned services to share confidential data in the first place.", 8bitboi terabaaphumain a_stupid_duck 77-q5 scribbbblr drgnfly61 Froogler None sentientwizard kskarthik chromaniac,create whatsapp govt proposes alternative service secure messaging

asdfghqw8,2020-04-04,Policy/Economy,14,45,False,"there is a global crises of leadership. under trump and his america first policy, america has receded from the world stage leaving space for china, space which china used to gain influence over the who, the current chief of the who always had a favourable standing with china, with his rival for the chairmanship of the who dr david nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current who chief has close contacts with china and it's leadership. these allegations are further reaffirmed when the who chief went to wuhan on the 13th of january 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the corona virus. the above events show trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. trump also took the corona virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example russia's interference in us elections and the khashguni murders. 

now coming to india, no political party in india has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two aiims. this is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. currently india has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. i'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to ayush doctors.

when the delhi state government, started to build mohalla clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the d.d.a, which is controlled by the central government, didn't alot them any land, forcing mohalla clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. as they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the corona virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in south korea.

the question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in hungary.

edit: i would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in india also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in india, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the supreme court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having covid19. couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of n95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. in fact a shipment of n95 which was just transiting through a u.s. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to germany.

is trump crazy, he is isolating america and americans at their time of greatest needs. for example germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from windsor ontario to north american cities like detroit.

im sure gobhi jee derives sadistic pleasure seeing people stand outside atm queues.


the only way to defeat this useless government is when fdi dries up and the economy collapses completely, then even chaddi clad bhaktas will be forced to vote for a change. because food on the table > religion.

that said, i agree with the idea that it's best if foreign businesses stay away from india till modi is out. sorry, but the economy collapsing is horrific.

there is no reason to make these statements whatsoever.

every drop in gdp is thousands upon thousands of people with no future or money in hand.

it’s decades of darkness, ignorance, health issues and ticking time bombs to defuse for india.

wishing or saying such things is irresponsible. change happens because people created or made an alternative. since none of us are doing that, at least let’s not encourage or succumb to negative and self destructive thinking. india's doom was always rss agenda since 1947. they literally don't want modernization for entire india, they just want their kids to have a us lifestyle while the entire country goes to shit, like iran or iraq or even pathetic lower end countries where only rich rules over people. rss loves the idea of slavery. and to do that, first the country has to go down to shit so that no educated person thinks about taking the country forward. if a dalit makes it big, hindus have a problem, if a muslim is a thriving businessman, they have a problem and if any lower middleclass gets to earn big, these rss have a big fucking problem. are you dumb? that’s bad for everyone bro but the most to suffer in this would be our friends who work for these telecom companies and if these two collapses there will be monopoly in the industry. the world doesn't give much about they just care for trump news and america you should try visiting the worldnews and worldpolitics sub all of them are filled with news and everything related to america just a handful of post related to ours go up. you will lose money if you have an sbi account. by some approx a single percentage point increase in gdp brings 3 million people out of poverty. we cant afford any more issues. but i do get your larger point, what the govt is doing is an an absolute shit show. what, and you are sure you will be shielded from the repercussions? what an idiotic statement to make. more than 10k people will loose their jobs.

these things aren't temporary. if it collapses, it's gone. india would never see any other telecom operator other than jio and airtel and people will face consequences even after modi's reign ends in this country. you will get it... within 2 months, everyone will have to port out to jio or airtel. voda cant afford the big tax bill you know once the economy really collapses, so will the government. a part of me also would want it to go down purely because it used to falsely deduct money on the pretext of subscribing to sports news, songs, ring tone etc. i can understand the customer can subscribe by mistake once twice thrice but not frequently.", plshelpthedog parlor_tricks blackcandleredflames GangadharHiShaktiman pela_kauwa Z3DLooP KnightRider44 dumbadmins ForthCrusader DrAj111199991 katlaki,hope vodafone idea collapses worldwide investors see shitshow economy become gobhi jee band incompetent retards make vile hate monger anurag thakur minister state finance know economy stands chance govt neither resources within understand economy willingness listen advice fix shit show cares polarizing country using hindu khatre main hain narratives effort win elections im sure gobhi jee derives sadistic pleasure seeing stand outside atm queues way defeat useless fdi dries economy collapses completely chaddi clad bhaktas forced vote change food table religion dear bhaktas vote turd real desh ke gaddaron

### tl;dr

iff has written an open letter to justice a.p. shah and shared a copy of it with the internet and mobile association of india (iamai). in it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. we have sent this as a response to three recent developments. first, the government filed a counter affidavit before the supreme court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. second, the minister of information & broadcasting prakash javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. third, hotstar india’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of last week tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to indian prime minister narendra modi. therefore, we have written to justice shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the iamai’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### background

in early february 2020, the internet and mobile association of india launched a new code for self regulation of online curated content providers. among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a digital content complaint council (“dccc”). the dccc has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the broadcast content complaints council (“bccc”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in india. notably, the bccc and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. when such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. as we all know, india’s tv ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

we have studied the iamai’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to tv come up in this context as well. it establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the information technology act, 2000 and the indian penal code, 1860. in addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the dccc and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

we believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague india’s online content space. at a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in india’s fledgling online content ecosystem. sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**iamai** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed dccc, the former chief justice of the delhi high court, [**justice a.p. shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). in it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the dccc and the iamai’s self regulation code. to be sure, the code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the iamai in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. the exclusionary nature of the code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in india has more than 35 payers. therefore, it is concerning that the indian government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### latest developments

in an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the ministry of information and broadcasting (mib) filed a counter affidavit filed before the supreme court of india. in it mib [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. this concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the mumbai mirror dated march 03, 2020 revealed that the union minister for information and broadcasting mr prakash javadekar met with online content industry representatives. in the meeting, the minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. this is clearly indicative of a risk that the government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the iamai code and come under the jurisdiction of the dccc. if this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the indian television ecosystem.

our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the iamai’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of last week tonight with john oliver which was centred on indian prime minister narendra modi.

### what have we written?

given these multiple developments we have written to justice a.p. shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the iamai self-regulation code. we have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. to this end, we have shared with both justice shah and the iamai governing council links to a recent report by [**access now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. the report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

iff will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

so... it's gone. it's possible that nirmala sitharaman doesnt need economics, just like she doesnt use onions. >the money was taken out reserves kept for war time emergencies

no. surplus was passed on to the govt, as is always done. the surplus was much larger than normal this year so there was much media attention. but the rbi still maintains its buffer reserves. don't speculate before you read about what was actually done.

> are we going to run out of cash?

i don't think you understand what the rbi does. it's not responsible for importing goods, its buffer exists to stabilize the rupee exchange rate. war time emergencies? where did you get that from? you seem to have a weird understanding of economics. most of your questions don't make any sense whatsoever. greece is a completely different thing altogether.

that money is surplus money the rbi had from its investment bonds and such. it became a part of the govt budget. that's all there is to it. 

no we are not going to run out of cash. that's not how it works at all. we are heading into a recession, along with every other country in the world.

money is not this magic resource like grains that you keep locked up in rbi and you run out. money is just a representation of labour. as long as the country is producing goods and services, that money will have value. because of the crisis, there are lesser goods and services being produced, but it will eventually go back to normal.

please note i'm only looking at the big picture. i'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of demo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**the good:**

* under the new amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people.

* 48 per cent increase in deposits in pradhan mantri jan-dhan yojana (pmjdy) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (november 9 to january 25, 2017). the latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until july 26, 2017 since demonetisation.

* several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including gst have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (source - [demonetisation, gst impact: india is fast ceding gold market share to china](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. demo paved the way for new acts such as the rera which further increase transparency. the immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (source - [demonetisation impact: real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). the real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability.

* direct tax collection has increased siginificantly due to demo. corporate income tax grew at 14% and personal income tax grew at 13%. net collections increased by 17.1% in fy18 and 14.6% in fy17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in fy16 to 1.3 times in fy17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in fy18.

**the bad:**

* labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. in the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. the unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018.

* in the immediate aftermath of demo, msme's were the most badly affected. small businesses with no access to pos machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. this inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (source - [demonetisation: indian smes suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* the manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. the nikkei india manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (pmi) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. the index of industrial production (iip) saw just a 4.9% growth in november, compared to 6.6 percent in october. (source - [demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/economy/demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. the ministry of agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (source - [demonetization: the impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/b1vftogwqhjdm5nkmg2cxj/demonetization-the-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* the rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. the pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the wholesale price index (wpi) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of demo. (source - [how demonetisation affected the indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/politics/ysbmktic4minsz1btccbjo/how-demonetisation-affected-the-indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* a systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. the performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (source - [indian demonetization and the liquidity conundrum](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as demo and gst further aggravated the issue. (source - [demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: us study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**the ugly:**

* the excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. i don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

a couple more points i'd like to add:

* just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to demo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. the issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. i believe the main point of demo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). i believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. again, just my theory.
* i believe the true purpose of demo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of india **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** i do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

summing up, i'd like to point out that demo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. it has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. that's the point of my post. thanks for reading.please let me know if i missed anything and i'd be happy to update my post.",an honest conversation about demonetization,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzs3p8/an_honest_conversation_about_demonetization/," i do not agree with your summation. as a small business owner myself, my overall takeaway is that it was pretty detrimental for the growth for many of us. 

earlier i was supportive of a move to eliminate black money but i saw my own income drop by 70% as well as many of my friend's startups failing or forcing enterpreneurs to get jobs instead of trying to pursue their ideas. instead of getting tax rebates and incentives, if small business provide jobs, we were burdened with thr complicated process of gst and huge fall of demand from the medium-paying client. > i believe the true purpose of demo was to bring more transparency and accountability to the economic system

can we please have this transparency and accountability in all aspects of governance? or is that too much to ask.

anyway its enlightening to look at this discussion, please carry on the financial perspectives, sorry about the digression.

the taxes on petrol and diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of modi government. while the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, india is busy dampening consumer confidence.

this news closely follows another one where the modi government fired urjit patel for not financing 1.56l crores worth of government expenditure.

the markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to c scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. in a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

the indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like petrol. the recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

in the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",oil slump? india will rather play dumb by raising prices,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/," they did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

it worked out really well for them, centre got a big boost in revenue, and no one seemed to have noticed or cared (going by the resounding victory in the 2019 general election). since the strategy worked so well before, of course they will try it again. chutiye hain, they are only trying to help out their financiers, corporate donors. the corporate tax cut was the worst decision in the last 6 months imho.

**tl;dr**

with reports now emerging that the delhi police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to right to information requests filed about the usage of drones in delhi in february. the delhi police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 delhi legislative assembly elections and during the riots in north-east delhi. this is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**wait… what?**

the delhi police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. the first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in december, 2019 when it was reported that anti-caa protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. this was in addition to the delhi police’s use of [**fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial recognition technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the delhi police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the delhi police used drones on crowds during the republic day parade in january, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. in february, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the delhi police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in north-east delhi.   


now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the delhi police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the government in a bid to combat the spread of the covid-19 virus.   


**the delhi police confirms using drones**

on february 14, 2020, we filed a right to information request with the delhi police asking the following questions:

1. whether the delhi police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. whether these drones were deployed in december, 2019 and january, 2020?

6. any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the delhi police.  


our request was transferred to various departments of the delhi police. we received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. however, in a reply dated march 13, 2020, the public information officer (pio) of the north-east district, seelampur, delhi police confirmed that they have been using drones.    


**here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. the north-east district has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. the delhi police has been hiring drones from the open market through station house officers (sho).

4. the technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the pio.

5. the pio confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 delhi legislative assembly election which were held on february 8, 2020 and during the riots in north-east delhi which began on february 23, 2020.

6. in response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the delhi police, the reply was “no comment”.

**why does this matter anyway?**

there are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in delhi.

1. hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. as a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. there is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.    


**so what now?**

iff has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). the only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in india are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca). drones are being used in delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. it is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. we urge the delhi police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. if not, we urge the delhi police to immediately cease such use. this is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**tl;dr**

according to a hindustan times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-smsyxkfoz9opg2vbikra8l.html) dated april 07, 2020, the nso group has created a surveillance application to track covid-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. this is the same company which was behind the pegasus software that was used to hack the whatsapp applications of a substantial number of indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in may and june of 2019. mindful of the potential harms of this covid-19 application being used by the indian government, we wrote to the chief ministers of maharashtra and chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the whatsapp hack. our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**what happened?**

last year on may 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the financial times for the first time reported that whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iphones and android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” as per a statement by whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. on october 30, 2019, indian express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in india were mostly indian journalists and human rights activists. of these a significant number are situated in maharashtra and chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the bhima-koregaon case in maharashtra and dalit activists in chhattisgarh.   


**what is the law related to hacking?**

surveillance such as this which was carried through the pegasus software developed by the nso group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. this goes against the decision in j*ustice k.s. puttaswamy vs union of india* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


additionally, the information technology act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. under s. 66 of the act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**attempts at reputation laundering by the nso group**

we are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the nso group in india. it was reported in the hindustan times on april 07, 2020 that nso has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the covid-19 virus. the report also said that the nso group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


it was not made clear whether nso has approached the indian government. however, since the nso group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**the coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the nso group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**our recommendations**

1. we recommend that the state governments of maharashtra and chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. the committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the state governments.
3. the committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. the committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. the committee should facilitate the registration of open firs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. the committee should operate in a transparent manner.

this is comforting, but i am really worried about the crunch in medical supplies.

i *really* hope that shit doesn't hit the fan in kerala. well well well.

this might be fodder for the kerala model detractors. but look at the numbers a tad bit more closely.

1.kerala is testing more than the rest of the country combined.

2. no deaths till now. gujarat, karnataka and mp started their reporting with deaths. gujarat has had 3 deaths out of 44 cases reported.

3. post-lockdown, there has not been unnecessary spreads.  these are all from a kasargod guy's community spread who was reported positive a week back.

4. kerala knows that fudging numbers are counter-productive but i do think that a lot of states on the future will hide numbers. a tn doctor working in the govt hospital claimed that the govt was hiding numbers just to be out of the reporting 'lists'. 

deaths/number of reported cases will be a really good metric to track how the govt and people are reacting in these testing times. they say they are most educated state in india(which they are not). people keep jumping quarantine and some even fighting with police.", nura2011 shad_iitm Orange-Tea,39 fresh coronavirus cases reported kerala friday cm pinarayi vijayan

i suspect the story will vanish without a trace now. although maybe they have found gold, and the gsi statement is aimed at keeping away speculators from buying up land in the region before the government can claim it. why will a mining official lie about something like this, that too to press? is it possible they have plans to secretly mine and smuggle it out or send it into private coffers? news of gold mine discovery was posted on r/investing yesterday and some comments there were doubting credibility of news sources and government on it and i was like ""fcuk yaa! you must be jealous"" in my mind.

but boy was i proved wrong! can't trust anything that's on news without fact-checking these days. aur karo india ka naam roshan videsh main. only 160 kg speculated to be extracted from the mine. banana

in a mixed batch, fast students get frustrated and develop a sense of non constructive superiority, while the slower students become shy and stop participating. reminds me of ‘lakhon mein ekh’. there is a saying in kota: bankers pay for rankers. what about the shitstain schools where they literally boot children out of their schools if the school thinks that they might not pass their board exams? so, will institutes like sri chaitanya, narayana, fiitjee and aäkash still be able to conduct tests to segregate? here, they teach diff genders in diff sections of the scjo. as a result, everyone in my class start to giggle if a girl's name is mentioned in a question out of shyness almost all leading chennai schools do that my school does this and i am in the toppers section. here's my experience -

1) you are expected to perform better than everyone else

2) when it comes to exams ( the ones conducted by school throughout the year, not boards ), you are graded more strictly than all other sections

for eg. teachers expect better answers from the ability section so if an answer that a child from another section gets 3 marks, if we write the same answer, it gets 2 marks. 

3) teachers always pit the children against each other by saying stuff like other children will take your seat in the section (there is reshuffling after first term based on exams). they think it will encourage us to perform better.

4) teachers put way too much pressure on us and expect us to study all day 

in the end, it just gets annoying and you start hating being in the ability section. that's quite reasonable but grouping students according to their performance can help boost competition. some weaker students might feel they're being discriminated but to others the same can be a liberation from undue pressure to to keep up with the brighter ones. each student has different learning pace and so segregating students according to their ability to learn can ensure that nobody is overwhelmed and overrun.", ishitawho None Gear5th IAmDefinitelyTheOne stochastic_zeitgeist accfordota The_Commander_AK hurricane_news madraspassion 0Xerox0 alou404,school puts top scorers section rest another violating rights court

>about me & my partners

i'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the indian startup ecosystem to start my business. i'm also a college dropout by choice so i don't have a graduate degree but i really loved the business we were running. me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and i feel responsible for them. one of them quit his safe cushy job when i messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. i'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and i acknowledge that.

>our business - what we do

our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. we're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. think of it in a way that i'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. i loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>how has the lockdown affected my business?

being a new business we were almost breakeven. most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. we had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why i said almost breakeven) and i was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. we had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

this worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

in january when i read about the first covid-19 case in india, i was scared. things got bad real soon around the world. with every passing day i was worried more and more about what i was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. i checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

but the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. the main part of this whole thing was shipping which i had taken so much pain to setup.

one thing i learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why india with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. it's because the vendors are lazy. even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. and i'm not talking about overtime or anything.. just their normal work cycle. they are not serious about it at all.

i had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. we had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. within a month i was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. i couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which i couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

i wrote all this because when my city got the first few covid-19 cases, i started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. we were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now i have an inventory of products that is ready to go but i cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. my shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of india.

i'm now in a sea of uncertainty where i have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever i have in the business account right now.

>the finances

i'm not even worried about the money, i'm worried about the inventory i have, i'm worried about the payment disputes i need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside india. for every payment dispute i lose, i lose $15 extra. the money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. the money for the raw materials are to be paid and i'm refunding customers everyday. losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that i might have earned.

>what do i mean exactly? 

now, i'm all for life>money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, i'm going insane. i'm having panic attacks, i don't know what i will do next. i used to have a plan for everything, now i don't. i'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. my head hurts all the time, i sleep for a few hours and when i wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

i'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than i am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. i'm not sadistic.

i have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

but i feel responsible and i'm not able to calm down. anxiety is on its peak for me right now and i have no plans to save us from this.

i come to this sub daily and i actively participate in discussions and disses but i haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

i'm scared guys, i'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

i'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

i'm going to try and sleep now. thank you for reading this.",here's my side of the story as a small businessman,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/," i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

i would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

feel free to dm. i love to talk to fellow businessmen :) i don't have any advice that would help you. i just wanna say, be strong. this too shall pass! stay in there buddy, you're young and that fire will bring you out. whatever happens, don't quit, difficult times bro! stay strong! a few questions:

2. can't it be sold domestically?

ratbert3,2020-04-11,Policy/Economy,21,2,False,"by 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the coivd-19 crisis. this problem is not limited to india alone, as all of south asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - india has a dark past with population ""control"". the indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the chinese state had in the past (one child policy). in any event, i personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

in my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. participation will be totally voluntary. the following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. it could be called the bonds issued to childless hedonists (**bitch**). at maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. the corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. in lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. the value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. i personally don't care for this, but most people do. in any event, indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. i think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. school/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. it's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. the best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

i want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. however, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. for instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its aadhar database. further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

edit: should posted this in r/unpopularopinion",overpopulation - how i would go about trying to fix it,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz16t8/overpopulation_how_i_would_go_about_trying_to_fix/," >cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the chinese state had in the past (one child policy)

i still don't understand why people consider this as a successful policy in this century.

anyway, i would agree with your bitch policy if that doesn't involve selling one's reproductive capacity and exclusive only for couples who adpot. i don't think what you wrote above is gonna bring any change whatsoever. india's overpopulation problem is mostly because the poor people don't have much knowledge about birth control, poor families also think that the more children they have, the more are the income sources, and many people also have more children because they want a boy child, so they keep trying till it's a boy. 

poverty and illiteracy are the main reasons of this problem. anything that the government is gonna force people to do will have more negative consequences than positive. educating people is only gonna bring some real change imo. make it mandatory for females to go to college and get a job. that works best. see western europe. see kerala. i'm sorry op but you are fundamentally misguided.

the replacement level total fertility rate is 2.1. as of 2017, india's tfr was 2.2 with the majority of the states already below the replacement level.

money is not a substitute for productive people. why do you think europe and america are so keen to take in immigrants? because they can't sustain with the low birth rate among their native population. take a look at japan to see what happens when a country has a low birthrate with low levels of immigration. 5 year relaxation for retirement age should be there for childless people. this sounds good. but will the government implement this i doubt it.", HerculePorotta goodyougo datamatix unmole dvaibhavd bronzecapybara,overpopulation would go trying fix 2050 projected add 300mn current 3bn reach total 7bn quality life issues exacerbated income wealth inequality we re seeing played coivd 19 crisis problem limited alone south asia gone is going boom putting pressure limited resources region political parties want touch issue good reason dark past population control state further cannot impose upon citizenry chinese state past child policy event personally believe inalienable right want bodies whether means 5 children children view what required policies geared towards rewarding children addition current policies encouraging contraception participation totally voluntary following awarded undertake remain childless issues bonds mature 30 40 50 years could called bonds issued childless hedonists bitch maturity bond worth market dictates required retire 65 instead child maturing taking care parents bond will corpus funded borrowings raised basis savings state projected make decreased spending public welfare services 2 alternatively could make cash payment would significantly less value proposed bond maturity 3 lieu cash payments bond issues could award agricultural land childless persons value land proposed awarded awardees 4 medals certificates mandated public approval personally care this do event society across board seems view childless suspicion 5 encouraging adoption policies noted earlier think could work open abuse adopting orphans payouts child abuse already prevalent adopted children execution would subject rigorous control 6 school university education geared towards encouraging childlessness clear resources need consumed efficiently peak efficiency resources consumed best way reduce environmental impact would children want make clear policies totally voluntary hint coercion however order ensure participants remain childless likely degree enforcement required instance participants undergo vasectomies tubal ligations naturally create framework follow continued childlessness participants said that already full knowledge parents children aadhar database further participants subject vetting process ensure coercion looking make buck human misery edit posted r unpopularopinion

bd really wanted to win more
they bowled very good, not disciplined as they had double digit wides but pressure bowling
our guys didn't show temperament and buckled under pressure
our bowling was fine, but strategy was not that great. lot of balls outside off stump trying for a nick. should have bowled much straighter and forced batsman to play.
we brought the game close but probably 30-40runs short or needed to break that 7th wicket partnership a little earlier.

you need development from basic stage, and one of the biggest drawbacks for india is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. i can share a small story that might interest some of you  

i come from a small town surrounded by many adivashi colonies, during my schooling i was an active football player and i even played inter divisional football for the south eastern railways, that time i used to see some adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( credit to their hard work and natural diet ), some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, we still had a hard time beating them, heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , i leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. i was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and indian parents in our country, our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, people like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

we still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, let alone the i league. community shield etc. isl is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

i still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

edit: retarded typos. a sight to see.. i’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. football is slowly picking up pace in india. with so many young kids attracted to club football in europe and better focus on training facilities, india will slowly improve its standing. but it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings. ...and got disappointed.", cshaibal porndragon77 __K_S__ mfoxin lazymetalhead ShogunOfDarkness berserkergandhi lazymetalhead die2code stargazerphenomenon wllmshkspr,60 thousand fans turned today support football team bangladesh

now, if they could get aew on their channel, literally everything i watch will be on hotstar. i watched all of cwc and ipl on hotstar. my subscription money has been earned back easily don’t forget the f1. though the coverage is not comprehensive, like they don’t telecast fp1-2-3. but still a place to watch the qualifiers and race. the only issue i have with hotstar is that their sports streaming quality is so bad! low bitrate and an awful player ; i tend to find other streams even though i subscribe to hotstar. yes it's really good with the different kind of sports it's making available. badminton coverage has been excellent.

wonder how much the media rights for a u-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). it's being organized by fsdl which is a reliance subsidiary. for a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. they stream f1. <3 does it work with chromecast? to the football fans, hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with jio tv which also shows some not so top level matches .

i have been in home isolation for a while and today went out to buy groceries and random food products. to my surprise some shopkeepers (not many) are selling basic items like biscuits, maggi, lays, etc at price higher than mrp. the price increase is about rs.4 to rs.6, which is not much but i don't like the fact that they are taking advantage of the crises and people needs. 

these items not necessarily comes under essential goods but i think its still not right. when i ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies. 

so here are my questions:

ExaltFibs24,2020-04-04,Food,38,80,False,,"this video is perhaps the first investigative journalism-style video i've attempted. titled ""pcos, sexual diseases, diabetes, and thyroid disorders: role of packet milk exposed"" the video critically examine the hidden link between consumption of milk in plastic polybags and development of pcos",https://youtu.be/i1WDzxcPYRw," i am dr. felix bast, associate professor. ready to answer your queries. thanks for the video. my question is why specifically the north indian population is affected when the milk distribution in southern india too has been done using plastic pouches.

secondly with regards to regulation most of the milk federation are government run or are based on cooperative bodies but don’t they come under ministry of health? aren’t there directions from them if the pcos cases have been so prevalent?

thirdly norms from pollution control boards have to be tweaked to control this any idea since how long have the suggestions been submitted to find alternative forms of distribution? hello mr.felix 

thanks for the wonderful video. a family member has pcos and the reasons we heard from doc was that it's pretty common due to lifestyle changes in the current generation. never in my wildest dreams did i know that a simple milk packet can lead to pcos through ldpe. 

since i live in a city where access to milkman is limited , is it better to avoid milk . i also heard that most indians (3 out of 4) are lactose intolerant. so i feel it's better to avoid milk ? the problem with unpasteurized milk is that it is a great source for various infections including tuberculosis. before antibiotic administration and pasteurization, about 25% of tb cases were from bovine tb. i agree the plastic is bad, but raw milk (even if boiled) still puts you at risk for getting a lot of infections. 


there is a reason most countries have mandated pasteurization of milk. 
https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/world-milk-day-raw-milk-versus-pasteurized-milk-which-one-should-you-pick-767509

edit: i should clarify. i am not against what you are saying doctor, just that there is a significant danger on the other side also. bottles are best, but extremely rare in india. hello doctor. this is great and frightening to know about this. 

these packet milks are not so common in europe and america. they have bigger cans and glass bottles for same. so these diseases and abnormality of hormones are less in those countries? hello dr felix, thanks for an informational video. if i search online ldpe is listed as safe for food storage and approved by us fda?

https://www.acplasticsinc.com/informationcenter/r/fda-approved-plastics-for-food-contact at least try to explain how the same compounds can cause both production of androgens in women and estrogen in men. most cases of pcos have 17-hydroxyprogesterone hyperresponsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation. pls do tell us how these chemicals which u talk about cause hormonal disregulation. what is the chemical pathway? if u can't, then i suggest u stop making such videos.

and can u put up any case reports of increased estrogen production in young men of normal weight? it better not be a case of receptor dysfunction since that has nothing to do with what ur claiming. this 'gender bender' which u talk about (what a ridiculous term), seems to be an imaginary condition. 

yet another half-baked conspiracy video. i encourage pple here to ignore this stupid video which has no proof of anything. good day this was very useful dr. bast. thank you for doing it. hello dr felix, 

first of all, great video. i just have one question. 

we don't exactly have access to milk man in our area, so only choice for us is to buy packed milk and we cannot avoid milk also as we have very young kids in our house. so my question is, how much time does it take for the plastic to release those harmful chemicals in milk? is it immediately? or it takes few hours or something? (sorry if it doesn't make any sense to you, but i think you will get the context)

reason i am asking this is to know how we can minimize the risk if we cannot avoid this. and yes we do empty the milk in utensils immediately after bringing the milk home and also heat it before refrigerating it. what about the milk in tetra packs? what are your thoughts on a ""whole-foods, plant-based"" diet?", ExaltFibs24 lunatfr stayhappyenjoylife lews-therin pramodc84 dnqxote Backseat_Bouhafsi bakar_launda Mark786110 Arjun_ arjunsitaram,video perhaps first investigative journalism style video ve attempted titled pcos sexual diseases diabetes thyroid disorders role packet milk exposed video critically examine hidden link consumption milk plastic polybags development pcos

pretty basic recipe:

1. soak daal + rice -> grind -> ferment... batter ready 

2. sambhar... basic cooking similar to daal

3. chutney... fry onion, tomatoes, daal, grind, mustard seed tadka

😋 few tips for next time

add a few fenugreek seeds to get the browning effect naturally. don't add too much it makes the dosa bitter 

when frying . use a cast iron tava. 
when the pan is hot for the first time - add oil. wipe off. sprinkle water and wait for sizzle

when frying - let the burner be full and tava hot. add dosa to center and quickly spread with a ladel or cup.
reduce gas and add ghee /oil . let fry till the dosa comes off the tava naturally. 

if the dosa is thin enough you do not need to turn. no roll=no dosa. 1. get a big spoon
2. heat tawa. then a few seconds before pouring batter, reduce heat to minimum. then pour batter and from center spread batter in a circular way towards the edges of the tawa. 
3. once spread thinly, increase heat. after one side is cooked and crispy, reduce heat to minimum and put the dosa upside down. wait for the side to be cooked and repeat. 
4. the first dosa might come out bad. but the process of reducing heat and turning dosa over and cooking will be perfect with respect to heat from second one onwards.

&#x200b;

also if you are keeping batter in fridge, make sure to keep it outside for atleast 2 hours. wow 😍 paper dosa? why no aloo on dosa...", realmischief holagvk hamster_mother Android5511 ReallyDevil yo_whatcha_doin DayaGatekholna SkyZokeR,new cooking skill dosa sambhar chutney

i went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so i called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

finally he delivered food, when i checked gravy i found quantity was less than usual (50%). also some gravy was over the package. i immediately felt something is fishy. i suspect that he took away some part of food.

i opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. i could not report the case.

after waiting for while i cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

i was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

i dont think swiggy is at fault here and i am also not 100% sure with my suspicion.

i have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order. 
this i heard from a ex delivery guy. all safety standards down the toilet. post on social media to raise awareness. had a similar incident yesterday, where the app showed that the order was delivered when it wasn't.

VelvetHedgehog,2020-01-14,Food,343,689,False,"
why do vegetarians in india prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? a look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. as is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. in caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a brahmin.

the percentage of non-vegetarians among scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. and in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among brahmins at almost over 50%. the higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

the burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

broadly, present-day vegetarianism in india constitutes a form of moral power of minority within hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. this new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

how fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? the morals of indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. in this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. the state across india through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",vegetarianism in india has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/," people in the northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=glzukz1fuqg

however, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘chinese’ if you want to see how caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than tamil nadu. the majority of the state is non-vegetarian. it has an incredibly developed non-vegetarian cuisine. ask anyone outside the south about the perception of tamilians and its always vegetarian. majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of tamilians working are brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by brahmins. for those that don’t know, this is dalit cuisine

would you eat this? perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? that is why these people started eating them! [removed] i’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. i know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. however, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. there never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. spot on. it's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. it's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. i belong to small backwards village in up where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

outside our village was a basti of the chamars

they certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. all they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both hindus and muslims without discrimination. i am haunted by a moment when i was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and i was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and i still remember the look on his father’s face. his father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. my mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

they ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. they also ate the flesh of all dead animals. they ate lizards, jackals, mongoose i don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it i mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, i will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
my great grandfather(brahmin) moved to west bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. i hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. i am sorry but you are using the words ""indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. i am an upper caste brahmin from the bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. in fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

it is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of hinduism. we are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. we need to learn, re-write and re-narrate hinduism to the masses.

there is a lot of hindutva propaganda. but let's try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters.

earnestpotter,2020-04-12,Food,7,20,False,"short version:

a  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   this makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

long version:

i'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  india, which i believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. while most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. i've seen   restaurants in european countries also do this, so i guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/t9jcnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t9jcnms.jpg)

going  back to naans in india however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

the   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  the more i'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more i'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual indian restaurants? most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while i'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. i experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so i did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/fj9phuj](https://imgur.com/a/fj9phuj) ,

so   i guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

&#x200b;

(asked this in in r/indianfood but couldn't x-post, so asking here.",do indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/," most of them don't. the bubbly part is because of the dough being treated to sudden high temperature inside the tandoor. the water inside quickly turns to vapours thus forming those bubbles nope,  they dont use yeast.  bubbles are due to air and watervapour  trapped in the  flattened dough  when cooking . 


in many cases they  they dont leave dough enough time for yeast to start fermenting. 

so its not due to yeast khameeri roti is the one made with yeast, i think. yeah i think so, also do you leave it after kneading it also helps in the rising and bubly layer", itheone123 drgnfly61 rebelioustomboy travscifibeast,restaurants actually use yeast leaven naans short version naan crumb seems airy bubbly layer bottom layer almost hollow middle bready glutenous structures image reference redd u5e24alw59d41 jpg redd u5e24alw59d41 jpg makes believe leavened yeast getting lean flour high enough heat seals deal phulka internal structure tandoor heat air bubbles phulka collapse flip actually crisped enough heat stay that long version experimenting trying recreate naans similar restaurants believe primarily trick tandoors recipes yeast yogurt end result always closer bread crumb pita shape naan ve seen restaurants european countries this guess leaven yeast relatively easier recreate home conditions attempt imgur t9jcnms jpg imgur t9jcnms jpg going back naans however crumb airy structure top bottom layers importantly actually bready interiors pita perfect example reddit r breadit comments euj3ov finally _got _my _hand _on _some _real _naan _and _roti reddit r breadit comments euj3ov finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti post claims bread contained flour water salt diary importantly leavening understanding bit bread etc feeling heat tandoor oven lean flour maybe bit yogurt flavor soda yeast bread anyone links videos recipes actual restaurants youtube videos home cooks recipe either yeast baking soda powder trying still gives breadier crumb naan actually thinking naan similar tawa roti crumb except internal heat tandoor crisp top fast enough stay there tawa roti phulka great air bubble roasting sustain experimented sourdough discard bit flavour soft wheat high gluten flour don t atta lot bubbles similar naans however stay flipping similar chappati roti griddle would bubbles survive stay bubbled imgur a fj9phuj imgur a fj9phuj guess high enough heat sustain top surface heat would mean could away without actually leavening yeast restaurants may use bit yesterday dough would mean sourdough style natural yeast leavening x200b asked r indianfood x post asking here

* take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. i use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* you can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. that looks fantastic! it's got me in the mood for a second lunch rice looks a bit overcooked or is it broken rice? i've never heard of using peanut as a coating but i do love peanut chutney. thanks for the idea! looks like kff i think you had too much water in rice while cooking not a huge fan of fried fish (why make a healthy thing unhealthy), but this looks good. why bro...why?? please don't post beautiful pictures of food. i'm dying of frustration (and hunger too). kon hai ye masterchef? kyun post karte ho aisi dishes jo main sapne me bhi na bana paun? looks so delicious.

1. since most of my friends are restaurant owners, i want to go meet everyone. i want to hug everyone i've known in the outside world and if i meet people i've had a falling out with, i'll hug them too. our problems are nothing. i really hope everyone makes it.
2. things i've taken for granted and really want to eat again.   
a)chocolate fucking cake. i'm buying atleast a kilo and the message is gonna be merry fucking christmas.   
b) mithai!!! if i knew things would escalate so quickly, i really would have stocked up. the only stock i have right now is of smokes and chocolates.   
c) samosa, and although vada pav makes me sick, i'm gonna eat that anyway. i miss it.  
d) pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(i'm anti anything by that company but now i'm desperate for some junk food) you name it.  
e) icecream!  
f) shawarma. oh my god i miss this terribly. 
3. things i want to drink- i don't really drink but when i do, i'm a spiced rum and coke person (thank you cambodia) but that being said, i definitely am going to buy myself some beer.
4. things i want to do- go trekking! i believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. 
5. i also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and i definitely need to go out more.
6. go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. i'm not a ""religious institution"" person, but i'll do that too.
7. go watch any movie in a theater.
8. ride a local train. i miss the crowds.
9. probably you. (sorry just thought this was funny)

no jokes, i think the list could be longer but this sums up the main things i really wanna do. if any of you around would like to join me for any or all of these things, feel free to send me a message! we'll talk and keep in touch and whenever the chaos ends and the sun's shine is truly warm, a one that brings happiness, we'll hang out.

so, antacids functionally neutralises acids in the body. so, if you're having acidity take an antacid.

hajmola tablet contains lots of salt and gastric irritants. 
salts help in absorption of glucose and amino acids. irritants help secreting more water to your stomach (which dilute the acidic gastric juice). they also helps doing away with flatulence (salts reduces solubility of gasses in stomach content). 
if you are young, non-hypertensive, non-diabetic, you can take one or two after meal. but otherwise, they'll do more harm than good. i recently bought enzyme tablets to aid digestion. to help your digestive system, eat good food instead of taking help to digest bad food.

check labdoor website for supplements review. labdoor conducts laboratory tests on the most popular supplements. whatever you do buy from a reputed source. whey protein from muscleblaze is decent.. tastes ok works fine. i personally use myprotein whey mainly because of variety of flavours. lots of fake products being sold so be careful and buy from a reputable source. one more thing its just protein so brands dont really matter, it is just a food source to get some extra protein. results will come over a period of time by being consistent, so dont buy if it has been only a couple of months at the gym. i personally recommend waiting atleast 3 months before buying any supplements. try to eat as many calories as possible if trying to gain and eat in moderation if trying to lose weight thats the only rule. i have trained many vegetarians so dont worry about protein sources. and keep working hard and eating good quality indian foods. you will get the desired result over time. good luck and train hard optimum malt chocolate or extreme milk chocolate is what i swear by i have been using on whey protien double chocolate flavour for the last 10 years. i am not a gym fanatic but only consume it the day i go to the gym. 
i don't and will never buy indian brands because i just can't trust their process.

the only downside is, if i drink it on empty stomach after workout in the morning then it causes extreme flatulence or in summers, a lot of heat boils(so i drink lots of water) ultimate whey protein . or any brand from usa. i have been using nakpro platinum whey isolate for 9-10 months without any issues. it’s basically repackaged hilmar whey isolate powder by nakoda dairy of bangalore as it is an authorised distributor of hilmar products in india. they repackage the 20kg sack of hilmar 9010 wpi into 1/2 and 1 kg nakpro bags/boxes. 

you can get it’s lab report from the company itself, or check the current batch with hilmar. also for independent lap report check out 20kgdown etc on youtube. i think someone did the amino profile test for it too. 

personally, i find it to be the best unflavoured isolate powder i have come across in india.

just buy cocoa powder separately and add to it for flavour. add a banana in the shake for sweetness or put 1 tsp of stevia powder if you don’t like unflavoured powders. go for on gold standard", ashishhp None None iamawierdo Kutiya_Kripya sinha7adarsh leafninja4 safed_beard notvalidusernamee RishabhPanty TheAsianhung,brand protein powder variant gaining lean muscle beginner supplements research looks whey concentrate digestive enzymes decent flavour best beginners ve shortlisted 3 decent brands nakpro muscleblaze optimum nutrition any recommendations welcome ve kind opted way costly gymgoers comment brand would best start along flavour variant keep short period till lose weight il homemade natural sources protein afterwards maintenance phase

ParmanuMan,2020-02-17,Food,19,46,False,"gujaratis have been involved in trade, buisness etc since a long time. from the indus valley time's  lothal port to trading with africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.

in order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won't spoil easily. this is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part",theory : gujrati food has so many dry snacks because of their long distance travelling since ancient times,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f5aarr/theory_gujrati_food_has_so_many_dry_snacks/," but, by that logic shouldn't odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far east. now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. it's based on my mother and my grandmother's account of her childhood.

basically, gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. groundnut was another crop. so you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. oil used is also the same while much of north india used sarson.. (which is non existent in gujarat, btw). white rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (my mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in south gujarat). in saurashtra, it would be bajra. again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (may be post 70s). 

my grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. for most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. no green veggies for summer. so you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that's what was available. 

actually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. the super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (i remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won't get anything...it's consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  also, they are not limited to gujarat only. even south has its variant of ""murukku"". the gujarati or rather central indian snacks became more famous recently because of haldiram maybe? even the ""murmura"" snacks are common in much of india. 

but yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. though that has to do with our ""save money for 1 meal"" tendency plus ""won't find vegetarian food"" problem. don't think it has much to do with the seafarers. they probably had an abundance of macchi from the arabian sea on their way to africa. this is the state of affairs. the op posted a theory based on geopolitics about food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the op or gujaratis. 

about the theory, quite plausible. it is often the case that even today gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. this is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as farsan (not just gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. 
but that's just my perspective, i am sure you will find some research about it.

if interested, by far the best travel food i have found is hardtack or ship biscuit. it lasts years, museums have hardtack from the 1700s which is still edible. plausible. i remember hearing something similar on raja rasoi show on netflix. don't know man. there are so many preservatives like salt, which would have been abundant in gujarat. while it is highly plausible that dry foods would be the norm for sea faring traders, we don't see the same in the southern foods, who traded with sri lanka and indonesia, and the eastern coast, who traded with the chinese. it's possible, but not conclusive. one i heard about rajasthan is that their food is spicy because it make people to drink more water than usual, given the extreme hot weather gujjus and their besan. it's the worst thing for nutrition values. no wonder the state has highest number of cases of under and malnutrition as compared to india. who always worries about that state's health and nutrition since decades. but why unhealthy snacks? do they have sweet snacks because excessive travelling led them to make constant sources of energy?

better order only those items to be sure? also epi pens are not available in india. make sure you carry multiple cartriges enough for the trip. can you cook on your own. sadly most indian restaurant have no sense of allergies. so please take your health in your hands i would advise not eating outside food at all. and only eat at well established upper class hotels. almost everything you will eat here will have peanuts in various forms.
only visit ultra high end restaurants.

noone would understand your allergy.

people here equate allergy with sneeze so they will think you are telling them that you get sneezes when you eat peanut.

if you tell them it's life threatening? they will think you are exaggerating. i remember exact same post year ago on r/india.

if indian vegetarians are lacto-vegetarians, then that means that they don’t eat egg. but at least here in europe, eggs are everywhere, especially in cakes and cookies and everything sweet. are eggs not used as much in indian sweets or do the lacto-vegetarians check the labels to see if it contains eggs? how does vegetarianism work in india?

there are pure vegetarians who do not eat meat and eggs. 

there are people who consider onion and garlic as non-veg and don't eat them too. 

then there are people who don't eat non-veg on particular days of the week or year. 

there are vegetarians who eat eggs, but this is not a religoius choice but a personal one. 

veganism is a western concept and almost everyone has a dairy-based diet. 

having said that, not only desserts, india is a heaven when it comes to vegetarian food. most of the ingredients are again dairy based.

also almost all cakes sold here are eggless. most indian vegetarians are lacto-vegetarians. the rest are ovo-lacto-vegetarians (some of them call themselves eggitarians in jest).

if there is egg or any non-vegetarian food in any pre packaged item, then it has a red sticker on it (a green solid circle within a square boundary). otherwise for lacto-vegetarian food the sticker is green. 

cakes usually contain egg. but eggless cakes are also available. 

indian sweets use dairy products, especially khoya (condensed milk i believe). 

where i live - delhi ncr - usually the western stuff like cakes and pastries have eggs in them by default. you would have to specifically ask for an ""eggless cake"" to get an eggless cake. yes crazy about milk, that's basically the origin of ""cow worshipping"" we eat everything except meat and eggs. >but at least here in europe, eggs are everywhere, especially in cakes and cookies and everything sweet. are eggs not used as much in indian sweets or do the lacto-vegetarians check the labels to see if it contains eggs? 

there is also a breed of vegetarians here who basically believe in ""what you don't know doesn't hurt you"". vegan is not consume any animal product including milk, there is slow but steadily upgrowing vegan movement in india these days mainly in younger generation. vegetarian is not consuming any living being, eggs are considered living being since there is growth of life within, hence in pure vegetarian diet eggs are not used. hope this makes more send now.

also, bit dick of this 'scholar' guy to assume he represent all americans with ""we pretend it isn't"" as if all of them legit can't stand it and somebody is force feeding them, when in reality it's like guilty pleasure (its thought as smelly,spicy) but many of them can't afford to eat it regularly.

he intentionally used racist-ish words to cause outrage. 

another tweet recieved similar outrage https://twitter.com/terrymoran/status/1198408273818537984

these people are what they call 'boomers' who hijack controversial opinions to parade their racist beliefs the replies to his tweets are just weird.   
the man just said about his preference and people are like, ‘i love indian food and you should love it too, and your are bad person for having an opinion’. i shit you not there are restaurants in chicago costing $150 per plate (avg per head cost of food and drinks) filled with non indians enjoying the best butter chicken they had in their life. difference of opinion isn't acceptable to indians lmao, he got what he wanted, which was attention from indians and the resulting publicity. people having their say on twitter won't stop, what i don't understand is why it's making the fucking news. it's such a non-issue, surely there are more pressing things to report? omfg! who gives a shit

>a miami university student kicked it off last week, asking people to share which culinary hills they would gladly die on. from there, the pot was stirred.

>""please quote tweet this with your most controversial food opinion, i love controversial food opinions""

mandi or shawarma were not as common as they've now become in the past few years. tho we had a lot of people who've lived across the middle east for ages refrained from introducing it with the fear that it wouldn't match the indian tastebuds. fortunately the agitation ended. the introduction of shawarma gave an astounding response here. it took time to gain leverage but once it picked up the demand shot. 

shawarma and mandi in most areas are not like how they taste in the middle east. it took a pioneering turn to customise and infuse it with the power of indian spices raising the bar to a much larger degree.

afaik feel in saudia started it all from yakhutpura, zafar road i still enjoy their shawarma legit thought you were posting about economy and shwarma. 🤷‍♂️ calicut too has historically had an arabic influence on its cuisine. recently mandi (don't really like it), shawarma and faham have become more popular. 

the arabic food i'd like to become popular here is majbous. good mutton majbous is absolutely insane. most of hotels offering mandi and shawarma in india are just b.s lived in hyd, best shawarma, bangalore next
