I don\\'t have money actually right now so suggest a way so that I get paid asap. Thanks for reading! \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8f\\n\\nUpdate: Few of you are asking my qualifications and skills.\\nAn engineering graduate, I have experience in WordPress customization, logo design and content writing. Apart from these, I do have video editing knowledge as well. So please suggest accordingly. Previously I worked in a company which had data annotation work for AI( company lost the project, subsequently I lost my job). Currently, I am learning web technologies like PHP, js.\",\"Lost my Job, Sick Mother and Paralysed Dad, In this lockdown how to earn online?\",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g014wc/lost_my_job_sick_mother_and_paralysed_dad_in_this/,\" I\\'m a freelancer. Don\\'t listen to the idiots here. You can\\'t freelance online as a beginner. That\\'s a hard fact. No one will trust you with a job. I\\'ve been freelancing for years and I know what I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nLook for NGO\\'s in your area and contact them one by one. Definitely one of them will be able to help. Also look for govt schemes. Call your local municipality or corporation and talk to them. They are waiting to help. You can also start a crowdfunding campaign.\\n\\nThis is a crisis time. It\\'s the correct time to lean on those around you. Look for an opportunity to weather the lockdown and then slowly start looking for a job.\\n\\nThere are no magical ways to make money online if you aren\\'t an expert. Anyone who says otherwise is an idiot or a scammer. Don\\'t listen to them.\\n\\nGood luck OP and take care. You\\'ll get through this, remind yourself of that often. Maybe you can add your skills to the post and someone could help you. Hey, You can work as a video editor for the Neso Academy channel. He is currently looking for video editors. Upvote for visibility! \\n\\nI\\'m sorry for you and hope you get some suggestions soon. It\\'d be helpful if you also mention what things you can do or maybe something like your qualifications. Add yourself to Fiverr and DM me your profile/username. I\\'ll see if I can send some video editing work your way. Everyone up vote this post.\\n\\n\\nLets help this fellow redditor Mention your skill set. Hey hey! If you are on Facebook, please write a post on Network Capital, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure many people will come forward and help you. Additional to that, reach out to organisations working locally in your area and like someone said above, try and fill the gap in a disrupted supply chain. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure working for NGOs right now would get you any money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be volunteer work only. However you can try and write to Centre For Internet & Society , explaining your situation and see if they can give you any paid work that you can do remotely. All the Best ! Really hope something works out for you. \\n\\nP.S you can reach out to this NGO called Milaap , if you need help with some groceries and food. They would be happy to help you, they also run crowdfunding campaigns so if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hard for you to find employment right now , I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to help you in some way.

Provident fund, Postal insurance etc. and so on\\nNo permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account.\\n\\nConsolidated Fund of India:\\nAll the cash from direct and indirect taxes, all the loans that are taken by the government of India and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government. This is the largest of all three funds. The government needs parliament\\'s approval to spend money from this fund\\n> The amount of money we pay as our taxes... They use it to gain goodwill for their parties(state or center) by freeing loans, water, electricity, transport and even their election campaigns. So in the time of actual needs, they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis. The Govt of India (central Govt.) runs a fiscal deficit every year. This means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise. Note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs.\\n\\nThe GoI doesn\\'t earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to a multitude of factors. India has a large unorganised \"\"off the books\"\" sector which doesn\\'t pay taxes, the Indian state doesn\\'t have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them, etc. This results in the only reliable revenue streams for the Govt being salaried tax payers, GST collected and some other taxes. From this, GST payments have been less than projected because the Govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post-GST.\\n\\nNow, a large chunk of the Govt.\\'s expenditure goes into schemes for the \"\"upliftment of the poor\"\" and \"\"rural development\"\", etc etc. The problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself. By the \\'state\\' I mean people who are a part of the state, ie: politicians and bureaucrats.\\n\\nSo taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism, to gain favour with the electorate so they\\'re elected again, etc. A lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption. Bureaucrats tasked with building 10 toilets might only build 2 and pocket the funds allocated for the other 8.\\n\\nThis is how taxpayer money in India is only used to serve politicians\\' and bureaucrats\\' interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society \\'uplifted\\'.\\n\\nThere is no accountability and no transparency. potholed roads, slow public transport, namesake education and healthcare It\\'s not a begging bowl. It\\'s a psychological tactic, they know you\\'ll donate when the country is going through a crisis \"\"even when we have enough money to handle the crisis\"\" and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks. \\n>The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?\\n\\n\\nBecause generations of people before you decided a spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our Indian culture. Now,those with spines exploit,and everyone spineless suffers. Blame the populace.thats where all the govt employees come from. Because if they have to give out from the government\\'s kitty, it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot. India is poor - its a banal and boring answer but it is still true.\\n\\nIndia needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels.\\n\\nIndia needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure (non corrupt officers, people used to following the law - the habits of civilization)\\n\\nOur tax income isn\\'t superb. Our usage of money isn\\'t super - we leak all over the place.\\n\\nThis means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during a crisis.\\n\\nIt also gives people a way to help - which is what most civilized people do.

I am 32, male and have decided not to get married. Its not my thing. But I will be honest, I am worried about old age, not so much about loneliness but about sickness, weakness, inability to look after myself, financial support (I can still plan for this). In India, I think people still rely on their children to take care of them in their sunset years. I will take care of my parents until their last day. But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?\\n\\nAny body who have decided not to get married and have figured out their plans for old age?\",\"Men who are 30+ and have decided not to get married, what is your plan for old age?\",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvy95j/men_who_are_30_and_have_decided_not_to_get/,\" Plan your finances. Work and enjoy in your own ways when you are healthy. Go see the world. Then move to an assisted living apartments when you are retired from working. Don\\'t wait to become a cabbage to move to such living. Make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there. Am 37 and unmarried. I think my only fear is medical emergencies. \\n\\nRest all can be managed I think you are missing the point of marriage. \\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less to do with spousal/children support as you grow old, and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships. As a 65 year old, let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences I have had in my life. It has completed me. She is now 30plus, doing her own thing, in another country, and I certainly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect her to come and stay and look after me when I am old and infirm. And I cannot but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter. \\n\\nMy wife is my age, and we have now started the journey of looking after one another. When she was ill, I stayed by her side, and when I suffered a heart attack recently, she stayed by mine. And we keep fussing over each other. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called growing old together. \\n\\nBut yes, I did plan financially for my older years, and those plans have more or less come to fruition. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a bonus. The main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships, although I will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems. But when you put everything on a scale, I would gladly go through all this again and again. \\n\\nSo don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look at marriage as a prop for your old age. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silly. Look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships,  and going through the joys, the trials and the tribulations of parenthood. I am 31 and single. The point of marriage is not to find a woman who\\'ll replace my mother. If that is the need then I\\'ll get a nurse in old age or go to an old age home. \\n\\nUnless I don\\'t find a partner who has a similar mindset, has a personality of her own, is equally ambitious and will carry on in future even if I am not around, there is no point in saying yes to a random woman just for the sake of someone being there when I am old. \\n\\nI have seen couples who got married at 26 and have spent 4-5 years just quarreling and arguing on pety topics. People who didn\\'t get a chance to understand each other before marriage and are now regretting. I don\\'t want to live in such a marriage. \\n\\nMy parents forced me into engineering and after two years I realised that this place is not for me. The argument that my parents used to send me to this Engg College was that it will give you a well settled lifestyle and secure future. After a year I was suicidal. Now if I get married because it is a guarantee to secure old age and not because I really like the girl (and she likes me back) then chances are that I (or both of us) will end up in a similar situation and I won\\'t get an option like dropping out of this course without thinking of some serious repercussions. Its crazy to me how many people in India look at marriage and kids as an \"\"investment for the future\"\" rather than the personal relationship they are supposed to be at the present. Guess that\\'s why arranged marriages and the pressure to marry is so common. Its not so much a natural alignment of 2 people sharing their lives and more like a cold business transaction? Its quite strange. Hmm.. a lot of people have expressed their opinions.. as of me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m almost in the same boat as you.. my suggestion is to start saving and invest in PPF, FD & KVP. Eat healthy and exercise.. when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re old and single, go to a old age home.. Shotgun to my face. That\\'s my plan for, when I\\'m old. > not so much about loneliness\\n\\nLet me ask you a question. Do you feel lonely now? Do you have friends to hang out with frequently now? Or someone really close to you?\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to answer that here. That\\'s for yourself.\\n\\nThe point is people get married because it gets lonely after a while. Now I\\'m only 28 but I know for a fact that I can\\'t live alone. If I could have a partner and not get married that\\'s fine too. But people need stability, legal benefits and financial benefits. So most people prefer a marriage. Not to mention that it has a social meaning to it.\\n\\n> But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?\\n\\nIt\\'s funny how you feel this already and yet thought of not getting married. The point of marriage is companionship. Kids taking care of parents is such an old concept. Let the kids live free. It\\'s only the parents responsibility to groom them, guide them and let them find their way. You do that out of love not out of obligation.\\n\\nAnd if you don\\'t want that responsibility, don\\'t have kids!\\n\\nYou and your partner will take care of each other. And you have to plan for the worst case anyway in case you become all alone.\\n\\nHope you find your way. I plan to never get married. There are several reasons for it, failed marriage of my parents is one of them, but i just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to convince my parents. Following are the challenges.\\n\\n1) my mom always tell me what will society think, like am i gay or something. No i am not but if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get married my parents will get embarrassed by this things\\n\\n2) my parents said i will feel very alone and will get depressed when i will come home and there will be no one to welcome me. (Like i am not already depressed haha)\\n\\n3) our society just treats single men as a threat. How to handle that.\\n\\nThis is all i can think of right now, and i am really messed up to have any relationship ever. So option of getting married is off the table. Just how to explain this to parents. Future is here bro don\\'t worry I\\'m 25 I decided not to get married even I told this to my parents\\nThe best idea is savings then you can afford everything\\nIn future, old age home and care is going to be a big business so don\\'t worry I\\'m so relieved to see so many people in the Same boat.\\n\\nEven I share the same fears about my sunset years..\", RedDevil-84 congratsindia khushraho kingof-potatos USPrimeMinister jprbruce operation_vijay cheesz Unknown-path yadhavanyaddy acitity\\ncataglottis,1586782749.0,AskIndia,139,130,False,\"Seems like everybody here is very critical of the direction India is heading towards.

I came back few months ago because of visa issues. I like staying in India with my family and friends but i would like to go back again one day. I feel like quality of life is way better in 1st world countries. I think people in India can have a good quality life but they put too many responsibilities on themselves , especially having more than one child. To answer your question most people who had a taste of living in 1st world countries will prefer to stay in those countries. That should tell you something about living outside India. This is my opinion , I like India as much as the next guy, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to offend anyone. I live in Europe and would like to come back to India. But, the same thing can\\'t be said about my wife. Unfortunately, women face lot of challenges in India - relatives and society in general are too intrusive in a woman\\'s life. They get told how they should behave a lot. If money is no bar, I will make India like outside countries and stay here only.   **\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb4** If money is no bar, I might not live any one place permanently. But given I must pick then no because I would rather pick somewhere clean air, water, no noise pollution, better security (law & order). Tuscany, Italy or Greek Islands sounds nice.\\n\\nBut on other hand, having so much money in India is living like King! But still i pick earlier as I won\\'t like fame. Moved to Canada a year back. Best decision I have made.\\n\\nWorking for the same company with 10X the salary. Wife got a job with 5X her Indian salary. The healthcare is amazing, the government actually cares about its people, the people are very welcoming. \\n\\nThe work culture is really good, no one works more than they are suppose to. There is no obligation of working more than whats assigned. Leaves are earned not begged for.\\n\\nMy wife has been extremely happy here, there is not a single week where she does not mention that she cant believe she wasted so much of her life stuck in India. Given the current situation and political landscape, i do not think WE would be moving back anytime soon. India. \\n\\nA few small but important reasons: I am a small time business owner. I have managed to buy a house and have rented an office space that is just 10 mins from my house. Traffic is a non issue for me.\\n\\nBesides this, I have 2 maids. One who cooks and one who cleans. (Not right now, but usually.)\\n\\nAll of the above makes my day to day way better than most people I know who live abroad and have to do the cooking, cleaning etc them selves. Not to mention the travel.\\n\\nI live in a city where I have access to good infrastructure in terms of healthcare, malls, food etc. Nothing to complain here too.\\n\\nMy whole cost of living right now as described above for me and my wife does not exceed 50,000 a month on most months. And we don\\'t compromise on anything. Thankfully neither of us has any interest in fancy cars or jewelry or stupidly costly phones.\\n\\nLiving abroad access to all of this would be much more expensive.\\n\\nBesides the above, the only other material thing I want is to be able to travel to a nice place 2 times a year. That\\'s also not super expensive for me. Traveling more than that gets boring.\\n\\nI don\\'t want any more material things than this. So, I am super satisfied here and get everything I want at a very good rate.\\n\\nThe big thing I like about India however is the potential: the market size is massive. Sell something of value to people, and I will max out my ambitions before I reach even 2% of the market.\\n\\nAbout politics and religion etc: Does not affect me. Religion wise I am atheistic and if somebody shows up at my door and wants me to convert, I\\'ll do it in a heartbeat. I don\\'t have a lot of respect for my default religion so why not change it.\\n\\nAs for politics, I think it\\'s a complex game. So, I don\\'t have strong feeling about how this is right and that is wrong. I don\\'t think I know enough to make those decisions. \\n\\nHonestly in terms of politics I\\'m just grateful we don\\'t have a insane guy like Trump incharge. \\n\\nLastly, and this is a small thing: when ever I am outside India, I am always treated like an outsider or a tourist. Only feel at home here where I know the language and look like the people.\\n\\nSo, lots of reasons to stay for me at least.\\n\\nMaybe others are no lucky and face different challenges. Outside. If money not being a bar is a literal statement,then ideally in US with a EB5 Green card, else either a fancy country like Switzerland or an immigration friendly one like Canada I just want a place with pleasant weather. I would leave the first chance I get no questions asked. Money was not the reason I left. However, some the major reasons that pushed me to leave (conservative society, lack of freedom, lots of sexual harrasment) might probably not have been an issue if I was super rich and lived among other wealthy people.\\n\\nAlso, I always had the itch to travel and explore different cultures. At 21, fresh out of college and coming from a middle class family, studying abroad was the only way I could live in another country. \\n\\nIf money were no bar, I would probably keep traveling and living in different countries while also spending lots of time in India with family.

A [research study from 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12560-013-9114-4)  on coronavirus in strawberries and lettuce found that the virus only survives on produce between four and 10 days, which is much lower than other respiratory viruses.\\n2.  This [article](https://www.firstpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-follow-these-steps-to-maintain-hygiene-while-handling-fruits-vegetables-at-market-and-home-8194051.html) tells a bit about washing vegetables.\\n3.

Can COVID-19 be passed on through food?  \\nNo reported cases of COVID-19 have been linked to contamination of  food.  The main risk of transmission is from close contact with infected  people. The advice to food businesses and consumers is to maintain good  hygiene practices and to wash your hands regularly. Thorough cooking  will kill the virus.\\n\\nSays this [FSAI website](https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html) Take doctor to a different doctor. How to solve the following problem:  \\n1. Vegetable vendor has a bunch of bananas in the stall  \\n2. Customer who has the virus visits the shop to buy something else, sneezes.  \\n3. Droplets fall on bananas  \\n4. You visit the stall half an hour later, pick up the bananas  \\n5. You come home, wash your hands (but bananas still have viral particles on them)  \\n6. You wash the bananas with plain water, but plain water does not destroy virus, bananas still have virus on them  \\n7. Your dad picks up a banana and eats it, now virus is on your dad\\'s hands  \\n8. All your dad needs to do now is to touch his nose There are special soaps to wash fruits and vegetables.

Yes, washing vegetables is okay, just rinse it with clean water so that no soap remains. If you don\\'t do that and put the vegetables straight to fridge, your fridge becomes contaminated with virus if the vegetables had that. And virus lives for a long time in fridge. Treat everything which you bring from outside as door knobs, except your doorknob is fixed but let\\'s say you bring the veggies and keep them on table and maybe even wash your hands,but they still are sitting there on the surface right? Cleaning them with any detergent based solution might not be good in the long run but surely the focus isn\\'t that right now I think he is sensible. Given the fact that there is no way around the virus when you get stuff from outisde, its important to decontaminate. Soap is best, for now. The only other option is to take the risk of getting infected. Choose one option.

I worked in a call center for 18k and lived on that. That was almost ten years ago. You are already earning. Leave. It was the best decision of my life. Get the f out of your home.

He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yelled at me or disrespected me ever since. I think if you root towards financial freedom only then you will be respected by your parents. 1. Get a job or start your own business if you are interested in that family business & use those contacts.\\n2. Get out of that house when done with step 1.

For instance, there are hostel services available where you pay a fixed amount and get shared accommodation and food in return. Such facilities are generally used by employees who work away from home. What type of business are you in? Maybe finding jobs in the same field will be easier. 1. Save as much as you can for the next few months. \\n2. If you are interested in government jobs and feel you have a good chance, prepare for any of those jobs. Don\\'t think UPSC. There are also several state govt jobs.\\n3. Another possibility is a teaching job at schools. (You need to complete a 1 year B.Ed degree), but if your father supports it or if you have enough money, you can try this option.\\n4.

If cooking interests you, somehow join a hotel as a kitchen assistant (right now hotel industry is bust, but after a few months) and climb your way up the ladder.\\n6. If you are ready to invest more time & energy, programming is a good field although it may take anywhere between 1-2 years to become good enough to start applying for jobs.\\n7.

As far as I\\'ve heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldn\\'t judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what I\\'ve heard or read anyway.\",Got struck by a cop today,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ybrw/got_struck_by_a_cop_today/,\" 1. You should have worn a mask\\n2. It was wrong for the cop to hit you Maybe it is mandatory to wear a mask in your state dude. You should have worn a mask, before going out. It\\'s different in other countries but we are not new here. Also, if not there you would have gone to thee pharmacy where the people could have also complained. Copper doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who you are. For him, you are the average joe loitering in the streets. And he treated you like one. You should have worn the mask. \\n\\nHe shouldn\\'t have ideally hit you, ideally. Unfortunately the cops have had to resort to these methods as they have to behave in manners which appeal to the lowest common denominators in the society, unfortunately. Inspite of all the efforts made to educate people, there are some who still ignore all warnings, or go out without masks. Mask pehen le lode \\n\\nNahi to gand pe padenge sote Police have got no authority to use excessive force unless you are threatening the safety and good order of the society. In this case you weren\\'t. Their action isn\\'t reasonable nor justified.\\n\\nBut we take their power abuse so much for granted that it feels normal. You can\\'t imagine such police brutality in developed nations. It\\'s not at all normal and they bloody should be reprimanded for that. It is illegal for a police to beat even a person who is arrested and is kept in police custody by a court, let alone a person for *making a mistake(your case)* or breaking a law.\\n\\nEven your parents don\\'t have a right to beat you.\\n\\nI think it\\'s just a cultural thing. Those we are taught to respect also think that is okay for them to beat us *on the pretext of disciplining us*. For example, parents think that it is okay to beat their children, teachers -> students, police -> citizens, politicians -> govt workers(i.e. police and others). Sometimes, with children, it even transcends immediate family, and siblings of parents also beat the children.\\n\\nI think that it should be taught that respect goes both ways. Students respect teachers, and converse *must* also be true. In simple terms, every person must respect others regardless of their age, relationship, profession, etc. One doesn\\'t need fancy words, while talking with kids, to show that they respect them, because, just the tone of their speech can.\\n\\nAs I learnt from reddit, *Be excellent to each other*. You are lucky you have not been sexually assaulted. My sister was teased by cops and she was scared that she would get raped. What type of tattoo you had imprinted If your reason to go outside was not legit, i would understand this obviously. But Tbf no one should use force or violence to make a point. It was totally wrong for the cop to hit you even after your reason to go out was legit. Everyone forgets , its human tendency. Doesnt mean someone hits you and takes you to court for it.\\n\\nPeople around the world should realize that and just stop exerting force and creating violence everywhere they go. > I can\\'t help but rationlize why I was struck. \\n\\n to my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask,  my mentally and physically handicapped niece.

All right my friend, how can I help? Could you please PM me your skills and past experience, if any. I\\'ll try to give it my best shot. If nothing else, I may be able to nudge you in the right direction buddy. Do you have interest in content writing? I can suggest you something if yes. If there\\'s a McDonald\\'s branch around, you can ask them for one. Crew jobs are usually based on shifts. You can work any shift you are comfortable with ( if they\\'re looking to hire). Also, it doesn\\'t pay very bad either. I have a friend who attends college in the afternoon and works a night shift at the restaurant. A full time work can pay you upto 8 to 9k. They also offer meal allowance. Also if the place is looking to hire, they\\'ll let you join in asap. You can ask in multiple branches whichever nearer to you. Likewise Burger King and Dominos. The job might involve serving and cleaning, but if you take it in a positive way, you won\\'t have a problem with it. Let me know how your search goes :-) i  hope for the 4 u. unfortunately im a kid n i cant help. but best of luck to u, friend.

My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).\\n\\n**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner\\'s first and last(and being your partner\\'s first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - \"\"hey, its not practical man\"\" way, but in a \"\"you just cant\"\" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner\\'s past is none of your concern.\\n\\nI still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife\\'s/husband\\'s past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**\\n\\n**My questions are -**\\n\\n1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe\\'s past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)\\n2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?\\n3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?\\n4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.\\n\\nPlease dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).\\n\\nAnd sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPS:\\n\\nBy intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.\\n\\nAnd I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)\\n\\nIts not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn\\'t. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)\\n\\nAnd no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.\",\"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner\\'s past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?\",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/,\" You are almost 30 years old, which is probably more than 1/3 of your life. Expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. There is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. Also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. In these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain \\'pure\\' or \\'sanskari\\'. And if you think of it, terms like \\'honry\\', \\'dirty\\' will make way to pious usages like \\'love making\\' for describing sex once marriage is done.\\n\\nPersonally, my future partner\\'s past won\\'t affect me as long as it won\\'t cause any problem with our future. I also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. Anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together. Here it goes. \\n\\n1. Men who have sex are not pigs. Sex isn\\'t dirty, it\\'s just sex. There\\'s no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. \\n\\n2. Sex is not correlated with honour. Looking at women as honourable just because she\\'s never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. \\n\\n3. Sex is fun. It\\'s nice. It feels good. There you go. Girls get horny too, you know. It\\'s not just you who\\'s been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. \\n\\n4. What bullshit is this partners first and last ? Are y\\'ll objects and properties owning each other ? Sex is just sex, it\\'s fun it\\'s nice. You can compare it to watching movies. The only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. \\n\\nAnd this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life I\\'ve been privileged enough to meet some girls I\\'ve been able to love. There\\'s no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. People do exist polygamous relationships. Sex is just sex. There\\'s nothing more to it, character, this, that. Nothing. \\n\\n5. Why does it mean so much to you ? Maybe you\\'ve spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that\\'s not what everyone does. More than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? Why does your morality have to be overriding ? \\n\\nDon\\'t blame others for the image of life you\\'ve created in your own head. \\n\\n\\n\\nDo try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with Sex ? I\\'ll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman\\'s value lies in her vagina. If it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. Why this ?!\\n\\n\\nIf there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who\\'s name the girl won\\'t even remember. Is this still a thing? I did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). Those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. So yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family. I am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.\\n\\n1. Not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. Even most is generalization.\\n\\n2. Sex is not at all associated with honour.\\n\\n3. Sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. For some it is casual and physical. For some it is emotional.\\n\\n4. Nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.\\n\\n5.  You are not the only one who thinks like that. If you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. But demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.\\n\\n6. If previous relationship doesn\\'t bother the current relationship then it shouldn\\'t be a cause of worry. And i am personally fine with that. lmao what the fuck is this post I think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic Indian trope. Fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. Sounds like an oxymoron. \\n\\nAnyway, as to your question. Having a past isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a deal breaker. You had relationships. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a difference. What matters is what is the current situation. Are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? Maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. Blah blah. These things matter more than sexual past. \\n\\nAnd honestly, look for a person you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re compatible with. \\n\\nSociety seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. But it is not so. A girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honor is not in her pants. We all need to understand that. \\n\\nIf you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship. If you haven\\'t had any relationships, it\\'s perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn\\'t.\\n\\nI\\'ll be downvoted here, but as long as you\\'re not a hypocrite, you\\'re allowed to have your preferences.\\n\\n\\\\>When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront\\n\\nI don\\'t know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don\\'t have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn\\'t. If she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn\\'t want to reveal anything.\\n\\nAlso, from what I\\'ve heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn\\'t even if they did have bfs. People have preferences, you have one. If you are not a hypocrite, it\\'s fine. \\n\\nDon\\'t ask her on the first meeting. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she\\'s comfortable with you. \\n\\nTell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. She\\'ll reject you if she\\'s had some partners. OP more concerned if you can see the number 90 on your keyboard than being a virgin at 30. So many parentheses those 2 numbers are faded out, no? Speaking for myself, she will be my equal. I\\'ll be okay with her history if she\\'s okay with mine. I had similar thoughts. I was 29 then. Virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from Govt school in a Tier 2 town, not much English skills and an average looking guy. After I got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, I told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an MNC , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. We got engaged and then wedding and after a week I looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. I didnt care much at first. but I asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. I didnt tell her I saw her emails though.  \\n\\n\\nFastforward a couple of weeks, I further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old FB chats and I learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. I had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. I confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. Things went only south from here. Because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only \"\"friendly\"\" she claimed.  \\n\\n\\nI still trusted her but things did not end good for us. I could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. But she is smart. It has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. A part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. I still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/Wife? I believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. Sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past.

Maybe you can even find a job anywhere over there, food court, multiplex, retail shops, they always need people.

Where you can earn some money.\\n\\nNo need to worry or panic in case anything you try doesn\\'t work initially, that\\'s how you learn what not to do.

Believe me when I say this, there will be a point in your life when you will sit sipping your coffee and reminiscing what you went through in life.\\n\\nNow focusing on the problem at hand. Since you have nothing to loose ask any and every shop for work that you come across. Target cloth stores and small mom and pop shops that might have a wanted boys and girls sign outside. Make sure that you are properly dressed and prepped up. First impression is the last impression. Be truthful in what you say you need not dodge on questions regarding your previous work experience and why you need a job. There is nothing to be ashamed of. \\n\\nBe persistent in your search and never expect an outcome in your first go. If it happens, good, but if someone\\'s asks you to contact them at a set time then you definitely do that. \\n\\nTaking cue from how well you have written your post, I think you can speak fluent English and and hopefully Hindi so drop in your resume at call centers located in and around Delhi.\\n\\nAll the best and may you find success. Maybe look for a job in the delivery industry till you figure out what you want to do with your life. Hey man. I\\'m sorry for the situation you are in.

My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They\\'re pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he\\'s their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he\\'s dated anyone they\\'ve given him an extremely hard time about it.\\n\\nSwitch to me. I\\'m very in love with him. We\\'ve been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn\\'t stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I\\'m Canadian. I\\'m about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don\\'t want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.\\n\\nSwitch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn\\'t think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we\\'re too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that\\'s plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I\\'m not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like \"\"I\\'m depressed from all of our financial problems and now you\\'re doing this to hurt me,\"\" every time he does something they don\\'t like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.\\n\\nWhat we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn\\'t have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat\\'s out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. \\n\\nI don\\'t expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don\\'t want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they\\'ll decide he\\'s \"\"settled,\"\" especially if he\\'s settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They\\'re just gonna tell me I\\'m useless for however many minutes. \\n\\nIdk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.\\n\\nTL;DR how to convince somewhat religious Telugu-American parents to go easy on their son for choosing a non-Indian girl and at least give us a chance?\",How do I get my boyfriend\\'s parents to give me a chance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/,\" Do not bother to convince them now, just sign relevant agreements and marry your boyfriend. After few years, once you get a kid, do his/her naming ceremony from your parent in law\\'s house, they will first accept your kid and then yourself. What a nice deviation from the usual gloom and doom. But I think zealous Indian parents may be as bad as the virus. Anyway. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing so far that you can do. The onus is on your boyfriend. Indian parents, for the most part, in situations like this, will eventually mellow out if the son takes a strict no nonsense attitude. Which is difficult for some Indian men. Being so reliant on the parents as they are.\\n\\nJust be yourself. Don\\'t try to placate them too much. They don\\'t have the right to give you a hard time just because you\\'re not the bride they were expecting. Telugu family..?... Try saying you\\'ll give more dowry... If they are religious, the key is the Horoscope. \\n\\nIt\\'s dumb but that\\'s what it is. Sit down and talk with them. Take the bitter pill. You\\'d be better of correcting what you missed out on from the start of your relationship - getting to know his parents. Bitter because this won\\'t be easy - they\\'ll humiliate you and test you. Go through it with what you have, but also be prepared to tell them off if they cross any limit - and they will. Call out on their manipulative tactics to your boyfriend - but also be careful there.\\n\\nIndian parents are a strange breed - and that too South Indians.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna get criticised for saying this, but fuck it: On the note that you\\'re planning for your future, ask yourself, is this the environment you\\'d want your child to grow up in? Always beware of a toxic environment.\\n\\nAgain, look out for any and all manipulative tactics.\\n\\nWishing you good luck. Stay safe, stranger. Have you considered getting your boyfriend to move to Canada instead of the other way round? At least that way his parents can\\'t forcibly take him back because border control is a legitimate hurdle. Just ignore them and get married. You being white is not the issue, you being someone which their son  chose (instead of them) is the problem. While reading it I could totally relate to the father getting depressed and mother shouting thing. That is exactly what my husbands parents did.(and I am hindu Indian girl, we belong to same fucking religion but is just not somebody who suits their prodigal son)\\nEven if they come around which will be unwillingly it is still going to be difficult for you for some initial years of marriage. \\nJust ignore them, get court marriage done. They will try to emotional blackmail your guy, hope he is smart enough to ignore that.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give in to all the drama of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are your parents, we did so much for you etc etc\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\nJust get married and let them come to terms with this on their own.\\nIt is your life and you both are the one who are going to spend it for the rest of your life.\\n\\nAnd if he is NRI then it becomes easy to get married. \\nBut if the boy is from India and you have to get married in Indian court of law then the process is a bit tedious but doable. You cannot make every one happy. If you guys are happy together, you will be miserable apart. \\n\\nGive them space and time. If after sometime, they still don\\'t listen, take a call. \\n\\nHappiness together or misery apart.\\n\\nEither way, take care and stay safe. How fucked up is it that there\\'s a post like this every month? Just tells you about the priorities that Indian Parents have. Good luck OP. Damn i am a telugu indian...spare with my english..ykr.... \\n\\nBasically (no offense to any one)  Brahmin caste is highest in the hierarchy in inian caste system and particularly too orthodox with their traditions customs ect....In indian it\\'s sad but marriages occur inside same castes...but there are exceptions in some cases were people get married to foreigners too.... All indian parents are like that(as u explained) .....basically but u need to figure out how  his parents are ...........\\n\\n1(completely orthodox) these people don\\'t care about their son or daughter but only Honour ..caste and religion always comes into their mind  ..if his parents are like this then u are doomed..........\\n\\n2(little liberal)they care about their son\\'s happiness even sacrificing their honour....take time ...meet them... don\\'t be like typical American...search about ethical wear,customs and traditions of telugu community..meet them in saree if possible..talk to them maturely not like a child  ..try to impress them.. try to be honest and they will accept u.......\\n\\nin general sense indian men are good.....

I tutor their child. Since schools have cancelled for the year in my state they have increased my hours, meaning that I am around for lunchtime now, and they have absolutely INSISTED on feeding me. This is very nice of them and all of the food they have made me is delicious, but they give me so much! I\\'ll tell them that I\\'m full but then they\\'ll bring me another portion, and I feel like I must eat it because it would be rude to refuse. Is there a way to tactfully tell them when I\\'ve had enough food? The last thing I want to do is disrespect their generosity!\",American wondering how to tactfully refuse food,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw3ws1/american_wondering_how_to_tactfully_refuse_food/,\" Welcome to Indian kitchens. This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.\\n\\nEdit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour! Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cultural thing. \\n\\nIn older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. \\n\\nThese days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.\\n\\nAnother thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.\\n\\nThank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. \\n\\nHope this helps. Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..\\n\\n1) eat slow\\n2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable\\n3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. \\n\\n\\nTried and tested in the field.\\nP.S: all techniques tested on my wife\\'s family where I face the same issue. I am fasting today. Typical Indian household lol. It\\'s endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can\\'t walk or that I am going to throw up.\\n\\nJust insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou guys also eat, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take how much ever I want, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to trouble you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - \"\"Yes, I do want more\"\". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don\\'t want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they\\'ll think you\\'re still hungry. Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don\\'t understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it\\'s clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don\\'t like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs.

We have a great understanding between us and we have opened up and talked about our lives before one another. I have grown up in a relatively conservative family. Although my parents were never against meeting girls (or dating one), I just could not devote any time towards it during undergraduate due to the heavy workload of an engineering degree. So this was my first real relationship and I am very happy with my partner (same age as me).\\n\\nHowever, her undergrad life was very different, which included lots of drinking, partying, dating, sex, and several hookups. Today, she is very focussed on her career, makes healthier lifestyle choices (no more substances and drinking), and is making conscious efforts to make a life for herself that she can be proud of (she isn\\'t proud of anything she\\'s done in the past and has broken all ties with people from that time). To be clear, I myself have never indulged in alcohol, substances, partying, or hookups.\\n\\nWe both get along really well, and I have been trying to be very open-minded about her past (given that it is very much on the opposite side of the spectrum to mine). I don\\'t want to sound regressive because I understand this happens, but I am unsure how to cope with the feelings of discomfort and off-putting mental images that come up in my mind.

If it was just casual between you two, you should continue no peoblem.But you\\'re looking at marriage.You have had a conservative upbringing and lifestyle. That\\'s your identity. Being with someone who is exact opposite is going to hit your identity and that will have consequenses. You might turn bitter and it will explode one day. To think that you should  not have sex before marriage is not regressive, it is what it is, you shouldn\\'t be ashamed of that. If it\\'s just your first relationship I would say hold on the marriage. Be a bit more experienced. Then you won\\'t be bothered by girls having multiple partners in the past. \\nThe girl is not in wrong here it\\'s your values and feelings which will clash.

It\\'s very common and none of you should beat yourself up for what you were in the past. Her honesty about the past is what\\'s very impressive. \\n\\nWhat exactly do you fear? You say the images of her past is off-putting, but didn\\'t tell why you feel that way.\\n\\n Is it because you fear that you might just be one of those guys? Is it because you feel like she\\'ll eventually hookup with someone else while she\\'s with you? Is it because you feel insecure because you don\\'t have the same experience as her when it comes to sex? \\n\\nI still don\\'t understand the sex part. I personally feel like waiting for the right person approach will ultimately lead to disappointment. I feel like there\\'s a lot more to relationship than sex. These feelings of discomfort you feel today, If you wont accept it completely, it will only increase with time... More time you wait to leave her more difficult it would get. Remember one thing, whatever you do, how hard you try, you cannot change your nature(unless you are very much focused,with clear goal of what you want to achieve by the change). Same goes for you and your partner. So, before taking any step, think thoroughly and apart from your partner talk to people whom you really trust. It seems you are not prepared for her past. It will keep bothering you. Think really hard if you want to proceed any further. Nobody can change his/her character, given opportunity(foreign trip/compulsion/family fights), she will do it again and again.\\n\\nIf she is still in touch with her ex hookups even via email/text/f\\\\*ckbook, they may simply hookup in one hour notice, when you happen to go out of city, etc.\\n\\n**You have to accept her as she is.**\\n\\nOk Bhaktjanos, now start down voting me. One thing that might help is talking about these things with her. As you have written that there is good understanding between you two.

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else\\'s life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.\\n\\nMy dad says they\\'ll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn\\'t have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).\\n\\nHe also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, \"\"they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,\"\" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?\\n\\nI\\'m currently studying abroad in a Western country where I\\'m obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he\\'d support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he\\'d be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.\\n\\nAuthoritarianism works until it doesn\\'t. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn\\'t affect you or your family.\\n\\nHow do I explain this to him?

I\\'m so over it . She says she will support and believe every forward above me her daughter telling her to just take care. Some people cannot be saved. And after an age the mind resists change.\\n\\nThere is nothing conventional that will help you. You would be surprised at the number of people in my family who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve casually mentioned shooting them down in the past week. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only person against authoritarianism in my family, everybody else seems to support it even NRI uncles who are minorities where they live. All my friends are sanghis too, two of my best friends (like top 5) have turned out to be xenophobic bigots, vocal islamophobes and RSS sympathisers. \\n\\nFor the fascists, it does not matter wether or not there is a minority because if there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a minority, they will create one. If there were no muslims in India, would everyone be Hindu? No. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be Brahmins, Dalits and women. Perhaps once people start looking beyond their privileges and start hearing beyond our fascist enabling airwaves maybe a bulb will light up at the end of the tunnel. \\n\\nOur own households are xenophobic, patriarchal and misogynistic. It can be easy to loose hope every now and then. However, it is essential that we keeping forward even if only by a little bit, everyday.

What\\'s the caste of your family? If you\\'re OBC, you can play the same game of High Caste vs Low Caste, as said in manusmriti. Not following manusmriti is going against Hinduism and Modiji. \\nAsk you father to pay more respect to his high caste friends. Lots of replies here mentioning you should evade or ignore. Wrong. You should clearly let him know how you detest his views without detesting him personally. This is the first step towards liberalism. Attack the idea, not the man. At the same time, don\\'t hold back from defending your ideas just because people you like may not agree with them What you can do in my humble opinion, is try to show examples from history or even in modern day - where people have been seduced into accepting an authoritarian strongman in the promise of a strong economy or stability (even if it means at the cost of hurting minorities). What we have observed is that these kind of authoritarians aren\\'t able to kickstart the economy in the way they promise.\\n\\nLook at Russia with Putin, Hungary with Viktor Orban, Brazil with Bolsonaro.\\n\\nYoj could also make the economic argument that persecuting minorities makes the country unfavorable to investment, to businesses and for the economy in general. Conflict and social tension decreases cohesiveness and in turn increases the probability of a tail risk.\\n\\nTake for example the protests in delhi, for the large majority of hindus, they aren\\'t probably affected themselves, but the protests have cemented a reputation of India turning into a hostile state for minorities globally.\\n\\nThere\\'s no point arguing over morality with people who have already given in to the dark side, if you want to change their opinions you have to be pragmatic and argue from the focus that personally affects them. Persecution of minorities doesn\\'t affect them directly and thus they don\\'t care, or they might even personally condone it. But showing how such acts can negatively affect themselves can change their position to a more moderate stance from their current veering towards extremist ideology. I\\'m in the same situation as OP.  My dad was never religious, he had many muslim friends but, now he has started making hateful comments. I tried to reason with him but he made an argument that because he is in the country, he knows better.\\n\\nI hate that the pandemic is being communalised in India and I cannot let him have his beliefs when, his beliefs are based on whatsapp news and TRP hungry, propaganda pushing media channels. \\n \\nNow, I listen to the anti muslim news he has ( like I\\'m genuinely interested to know), I then share fact checked articles on it and complain about shitty media.

And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don\\'t get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? \\n\\nAnother thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won\\'t several million people just die due to lack of money and food?\\n\\nEdit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn\\'t harm young people.

Everyone is stocking up now, so there are some shortages. In a week to 10 days, there will be surplus because noone will be buying at the time.\\n\\nYes, life for poorer people is going to be very very difficult.\\n\\nHowever, hopefully people will learn that a lockdown is not a curfew. There is no restriction n going out for essential purposes and neither is there any closure of essential services. Hopefully we will be able to develop a rythm\\n\\nEconomy wise of course, things are going to be very very bad. Not a stupid question. It\\'s a really important question. I don\\'t know too much about it, but essential items include food items and groceries, so inter-state transport of these stuff is allowed.\\n\\nCentre and state should announce a DBT to the poorer people soon, to compensate for loss of work. And also make available groceries as well. Neither can they work, nor do they have money. Kerala has announced that groceries would be available. Similarly Delhi has announced the same. Centre needs to augment the states with similar stimulus package. They should, in theory, be able to help out the poorer strata. The civil society organisations as well as private industries should also help out in this manner. Adopt a district or a village or couple of families. We can help oit as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s gonna be a rough couple of years for Modi and his cabinet. The economy was already on a downslide, it could go into free fall soon. We need to inject state money into the market sooner rather than later.\\n\\nAnd since it\\'s a contagious disease, loss of lives due to illness would inevitably be larger than loss of lives due to lack of food or lack of money, if unfettered movement continues. Look at Italy. They went about normally around their days and they\\'re fucked. And also, the poor strata would be disproportionately affected due to COVID as well. I can afford to go to a private hospital for treatment, the poor cannot. \\n\\nLockdown is just more effective to contain COVID. And like always, poor are collateral damage. It\\'s not a stupid question. It will impact or already has, around the world its not only our country. There will be a ripple effect across industries those money muscle might even close. It will recover with time as with any calamity. Dude if there\\'s no lockdown , there won\\'t be any economy left . Maybe not, I mean China and South korea managed to contain by observing strict quarantines. It\\'s definitely possible. There are two important points one is loss of life and resources the second and probably more devastating is the breaking up of supply chains.\\nThe first one in a young population is quite maintainable and we could probably have lost a few million people and no one would bat an eye but the second one is much more devastating.\\nLet\\'s say the goverment does not lockdown and in a few months we have those millions death I talked about before.Then it spreads rapidly, causing people to drop out of work, panic buy and hoard in turn caussing essential services to shut down. Population becomes aggrresive and downright uncontrollable that\\'s when we lose trillions of dollars in economic impact and many many millions more people due to food shortage, distribution problems and in general lack of essential services. \\nNote: Increased cases also mean our health infrastructure crumble as professional start getting sick and scared causing them to run away from work. about your edit: it effects every one.

I saw a post of  a doctor who helplessly saw one his 24M patient die gasping for air.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCurrently the thought process goes like, we will rebuild the economy if we live to see it through.

Also its not like healthy young adults are completely \"\"immune\"\" to the worst effects of disease. \\n\\nBy the end of the year I\\'m sure some other disease will be the largest cause of death but Covid-19 will have killed more in a shorter time span while bringing the healthcare system to its knees. The loss of lives if there are zero checks would be scales of magnitude higher than if there is a lockdown.\\n\\nThere\\'s a great study by the Financial Times on this.\\n https://mobile.twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240629424871047168\\n\\nWith zero checks, the US death toll would be 2.2 million.

So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. \\n\\nAlso if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve.

I\\'d say 1) Ramp up testing rates 2) Ensure everyone has masks to wear 3) Revoke lockdown in phases I feel like places will be more highly crowded than usual with people who are desperate to go out.\\n\\nI think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all be waking up to a new reality after this lockdown is lifted.  I feel many more people will continue to get infected and die. # NO\\n\\nwait, lockdown? The one we break every Sunday? Lockdown without a comprehensive testing strategy and a phased release would be ineffective and perpetual. we have actually wasted these 14 days by not testing enough. should have tested around 5 L people by now. The extension of lockdown is necessary now. No. If it\\'s really required, we should open up cities and districts (for travel inside these zones) with no cases, but people should not be able to enter or leave these zones. In my area I know families which are really struggling to accumulate money for upcoming months.\\nThey have issues like money to pay for childrens school, they are not earring anything right now how they are going to sustain any expenditure in future months. \\nThose families somehow managing their food with government support and relatives debt but man believe me situation is do or die for them...\\nThey need a way to earn money, so in that sense lockdown should be uplifted.\\n\\nAt least for them... The real number of cases in India is at least 10 times the official number of cases. We know that a majority of novel Coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, i.e. no cough and cold, no fever, no breathing distress. Among the 20%-25% cases which are symptomatic, very few have symptoms severe enough to warrant a visit to the hospital (let\\'s say 10% of the real number of infected cases, I don\\'t have any stats to back up this number, I just pulled it out of thin air), and only 2%-3% will die. \\n\\nConversations with doctors (and their FB posts) in many rural districts of my home state (WB) have shown me that the situation is dire. Doctors and nurses finally have enough PPE, but the overwhelming number of cases has totally destroyed the brittle public health infrastructure. Most patients with COVID-19 symptoms are just getting pneumonia and malaria medicines, and are being sent home, because there aren\\'t enough testing kits, and not nearly enough beds.\\n\\nMake no mistake, the real, actual number of people infected in India could well be past 1 crore at this point, and we still wouldn\\'t know unless the govt AGGRESSIVELY ramps up testing. In such a situation, where so many migrant workers who\\'ve returned to their villages as asymptomatic carriers, in addition to people who\\'ve attended various religious gatherings, the national lockdown doesn\\'t really matter. It won\\'t stop the spread any further. It is over, coronavirus has won, and a population roughly the size of Dharavi is expendable. Well. I\\'d like to be out and about again but its very difficult for me to decide. I\\'d like things to be normal but we have a pathetic medical system and we wont be able to control the spread of the virus if we do.

If you find yourself unfamiliar with the topics being raised and the themes being discussed, then start doing research on these topics.\\n\\nFor me personally both articles are largely full of hot air, and of not much significance outside of intellectual masturbation.\\n\\nWhile Taseer has a claim in that he has held PIO/OCI status for decades in spite of his Pakistani origin, it is also a fact that clerical error by the government is not an excuse to bestow unauthorised privileges to any individual ineligible for them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Singh plays the \"\"what about Pakistan and the UK\"\" card, aka *tu quoque* or the appeal to hypocrisy fallacy to discredit Taseer\\'s claims. After all, India\\'s actions should be reactionary to what Pakistan or the UK are doing and there are no better standards than these two countries if we do have to compare. I don\\'t think an op-ed should lead you to form your mind on anything. If that was the case then Aatish Taseer\\'s post is more articulate, less hateful and obviously more credible. \\n\\nEvaluate the facts, and let your own sentiments guide you. Do you agree or disagree with the people who are saying these things and if so, why ? Considering the hit piece on Aatish reads like a  juvenile retort with shit like \\n\\n> Aatish Taseer is both Indian and Pakistani and neither; neither Hindu nor Muslim, but also both; colored, immigrant in the West; an exotic dream of all the feminists; male and female; of every democracy where universities are factories for pumping out legions of Social Justice Warriors.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any reason to take it seriously. The critic is crying out why Mr. Taseer is not criticizing Pakistan. The article Taseer wrote is about India. Taseer grew up in India and had Indian residency papers until recently. Why should he talk about Pakistan? Maybe he will if he writes an article about Pakistan. The critic is not addressing the points Taseer is raising but rather going on about leftists.\\n\\nIf your critic starts calling you some \"\"ist\"\", that is a minus point for him, because rather than address your argument, they place you in a group and then attack you with all the malice they have for that group.

But where it protects the state from Religious Law, it also protects freedom of belief and conscience from persecution or manipulation by the state. That is true secularism. Marxist secularism however does not seek a separation between belief and state. The Marxist ideal is an ideological state, and the ideology tolerates no rivals. While the Marxist working class rights origins of the Left have disappeared, Marxism has mutated and switched from economics to culture. Now the ideology is that the Christian White men, Hindu Nationalists and Zionists are the oppressors, and their victims are righteous in uniting in revolution.\\n\\nAnd as always, these people haven\\'t read marx but like to think they know everything about him.

However, if you still choose to do it without a lawyer, approach the family court in your city and ask for the Admin of the court.\\n\\nSubject to your circumstances, divorce can be easily filed in your resident state. That will depend on your specific circumstances and, if you\\'re going without a lawyer, the Court Admin will be able to assist you.\\n\\nCan assist you if you have any more questions.

If you want to file it in another city, you will have to say you got married there. But that would be lying on oath so I would advise against that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you are intent on doing it on your own, read Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act and draft a petition accordingly. just logically, why would 2 adults need to inform their parents about their actions? you don\\'t need to inform them when you take a loan or buy a house. Always get a lawyer. And tell everyone who will be impacted in any way by the decision. Divorces are anyway complicated and messy on many levels, mutual or contested. No reason to add to that. I am reminded of the Marriage Story film. They decide that they don\\'t need lawyers and then wife gets an expensive shrewd lawyer. Protect yourself, dude. Hi everyone, just asking. How often do the mandatory counselling sessions happen? What if I am an NRI and my wife remains in India. Does that complicate things? What is the need of alimony in this case?

It means his loans will be paid out of his assets, not yours. If you are not inheriting his belongings, you are in no way responsible for any of his loans. If he has loans, contact a lawyer who will approach a court to establish an estate and pay off loans. If the estate or the sum total of his assets is less than the sum total of his loans, the creditors will bear a loss. If the sum total of his assets exceed the sum total of his loans, the balance of the estate or the remainder after his loans are paid off, will be inherited by the heir.\\n\\nA private limited company lives on regardless of the death of it\\'s directors. Remember, a private limited company has limited liability, hence any credits or loans on the company will be paid out of the company\\'s assets only. There has been a Supreme Court guideline against this however, be sure to consult a lawyer or a CA be clear on this. The closing of a private limited company is a legally complex and time consuming affair. Contact a CA and get the process starts as soon as possible.

Assuming there is a will and depending on which city you reside you may have to get the will probated from a court. Due to CoVid-19 pandemic, this will take longer than normal.

Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nKumari said in an interview: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I was born with this defect and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\nAs she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.\\n\\nIt has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, \\xe2\\x80\\x98The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but never help. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOne of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.\\n\\nOn hearing Kumari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.\\n\\nIn 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nLet\\'s hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nWatch video- [Women with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life](https://streakshot.com/weird-news/women-with-31-fingers)\",Women in India with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjj42g/women_in_india_with_31_fingers_called_a_witch/,\" Heartless people. It\\'s all about brain washing... If she had family members/other acquaintances who told everyone that she was an incarnation of some indian goddess, people would have believed that too in a jiffy.. I guess it matters where(as in status and stuff) you are born in India for being labelled as a witch or goddess That\\'s just the culture of our country. Anything different from the norm is considered a \\'curse\\' and some sort of witchcraft or a dark force. We are highly resistant to difference/anomalies , and for as long as that is the case, we will never evolve. There should be provisions under which a register of such people is maintained and are looked after. >In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. \\n\\nAnd I thought it only happened in medieval Europe People still won\\'t upvote this post.

This is just one story, just think about all the people that commit suicide because of this shit and we never even hear about them. Oh how it hurts reading this. How people are reacting to her. I\\'m going to assume that she never hurt anyone, yet is shunned by all. This mentality of people in remote villages hits extremely close. I agree with u/insomniac_hatake. It\\'s all about how you sell it. Lots of Indians default to shunning and hating the thing that they don\\'t understand. But if her family/relatives sold the idea as an incarnation of a goddess, she would have people praying to her and offering her and her family, tons of respect and fear. I can\\'t imagine the mental stress she had to go through. 63 years of being socially isolated and humiliated. That\\'s more than what most people can take. Can\\'t believe how primitive and superstitious people can get. I see what they did there. Someone needs to manufacture a custom shoe for her. It would be a lot easier to conceal.

Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.\\n\\nI will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment.

Given an option, a monkey never chooses to live near an apartment complex or cables. The trees they live on are cut down and they intrude. For dogs, sterilisation is a must and some cities do a good job of it. \\nFor monkeys, maybe catch them and send them off to religious sites. I see many temples with monkeys peacefully coexisting. Monkeys - easy. Create more wild spaces. India anyway needs much much more of green areas. Plant trees that can provide food for the monkeys. And better the environment too. \\n\\nDogs - most strays are more like public pets, which are fed by the neighborhood. Designate 1-2 people from each street to impart the dogs basic training. Untrained/misbehaved dogs are a nuisance, but well-behaved/trained dogs are a delight! It is really very easy to get dogs to behave. They have coexisted with humans for millenia. \\n\\nIf dogs bark too much at night, throw small stones at them while they are barking - so they get the message that barking invites stones. >In civilized cities, there is no place for stray animals. \\n\\nIts not  very civilised to encroach wild habitat for building cities and then think that humans are the only ones with right to live.

And any time talk of euthanizing them comes up, there are a bunch of activists who talk about being humane and cancel the plan. I\\'m sorry, but if I see a dog potentially hurting my loved ones or anyone for that matter, I would have no qualms in it being captured and handled in whatever way required.

My concern is that they aren\\'t fans of secularism yet are very pro-UCC, which sounds paradoxical and makes me wonder what the motivation is, if that makes sense. Lift beef ban. You can\\'t allow special treatment for some religious laws. Firstly, the Civil code defines the relationships between two or more individuals and not the relationship between an individual and the state. The lack of an uniform civil code doesn\\'t mean that there is any discrimination on the basis of religion when it comes to the relationship between the state and an individual.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be difficult to impose a civil code in India due to the huge variation of beliefs and customs among communities within the country. For example, marriages between close cousins are common in parts of TN, that are otherwise illegal in rest of India. If one believes that all these variations in customs should be respected, an uniform civil code is a non-starter. Abhi sab thande baste mein daal diya hai. Check after June 2020. Uniform Civil Code will be a boon for Indian Muslims as a whole, if implemented uniformly that is. Most of the Muslim personal laws are bad for Muslim women, thereby stopping them from progressing in the society. 50% of the demographics held back because Muslim men can\\'t let go of the power and control they have over Muslim women. Having laws that stop that will benefit the entire Muslim community. Only the regressive orthodox Muslim men will lose some privilege here. \\n\\n\\nGoing by the past records, the BJP government will never implement it uniformly. They\\'ll only focus on how it can used a beating stick to harm the Muslim community even more. Even Congress under Rajiv Gandhi did the same, who also toyed with gaining the support of Hindutwadis, so we can\\'t expect any better from the worse alternative. As  usual, there is no discussion as to what this UCC would be?\\nJust stating that there should be, does not matter much and given past and current BJP policies has to be viewed with suspicion at least. \\n\\nHaving separate civil codes for the religions is perhaps what makes it secular as all of the major religions are represented. \\nSecular does not mean lack of religion. It only means that the state does not prefer one religion over another. \\nWhat is UCC?\\nExplain it in more than just a one liner and then we can discuss. Again this is just a fear of people. The implementation of UCC may follow the modus operandi of CAA. CAA alone could have been beneficial to some illegal migrants from neighbouring countries but it was coupled with NRC and hence had mass opposition. \\n\\n\\nHence there is a fear of what may be implemented in the name of UCC. There are chances of taking away religious freedom enshrined in constitution. Many countries across the world allow personal laws of each community as long as they are not going against the constitution. \\n\\nLike triple Talaq was made illegal as per demand of Muslim women but the government also made it criminal act by introducing jail terms by the BJP on its own without any such demands from the women organisation. Why? It is such actions from the government that make people wary of BJP and its aim in introducing UCC. \\n\\nBTW India is not a secular nation, so maybe they should just declare it a Hindu rashtra and just enshrine protection for minorities in constitution including reservation like in Pakistan.\", Cerebral_aqueduct foreverall1 the_S1lence freestyle50m cosmogli MainbhiBhakt zafar_bull\\nCrasterMumble,1586621270.0,AskIndia,28,18,False,\"Hello r/India!\\n\\nNon Indian here.

They mass produced test kits very early and more importantly they sacrificed privacy of citizens to do contact tracing. 95 percent of their citizens have smart phones and government could get their location data. govt is doing image management but not forthcoming with granular data about the tests. safe to assume they are doing jack shit.

TW: Sexual abuse/assault\\n\\nHi reddit.\\n\\nFor context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. \\n\\nI\\'ve made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my \"\"area\"\" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn\\'t stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn\\'t. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn\\'t allow me to heal from this. I\\'m conflicted because he is not a \"\"bad\"\" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I\\'ve been around him A LOT these past few years, and we\\'ve had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don\\'t know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don\\'t know how to bring this up. I don\\'t even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I\\'m prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it\\'s a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated! Thanks!\",My cousin is a sexual abuser. Do I confront him?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqdz4b/my_cousin_is_a_sexual_abuser_do_i_confront_him/,\" As a guy, with female cousins I can tell you your first cousin is an asshole, he definitely remembers what all he did and it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'ve had great times after.. he is an abuser, put you in a vulnerable spot and exploited it because he probably figured you won\\'t tell anyone.. I would make the younger ones in the family aware to stay away from him, upto your judgment to disclose anything, but make sure he doesn\\'t do this to anyone 3else.. sorry for the long response but he sounds like a predator.. I would punch him in his balls if I knew who he was.. Have a chat with him and let him know how you feel >My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness?\\n\\nIt all comes down to your mental health. If you think this\\'ll help your mental health. Go ahead and forgive him. \\n\\n>but does he deserve to know I have forgiven him?\\n\\nYou can forgive someone and still never see their face again or talk to them or let them have any authority on you. He did a shitty thing. Forgiveness is more for you than it is for him. And honestly, seeing so many of these cases personally, he doesn\\'t give a bloody rats ass if you forgive him or not. He probably will do it again if situation comes to it. Hey, I hope you are doing okay and holding up well. Writing a post and reading the comments can be triggering.  \\n\\nChild sexual abuse usually happens by people known to the child, as there is a certain level of trust that is enjoyed by the perpetrator which ensures silence from the child. I use the phrase child as i understand you were a minor at that time. The freezing part you wrote about is a body\\'s response to a shocking situation that we may find ourselves. There were times when you were able to say stop, and i am sure it must not have been easy for you at all and requires a lot of courage. \\n\\nI see that you talk about confronting him and forgiving him in your post. I understand that it\\'s important for you. And hence, more than speaking to the person, I feel you\\'d have to first find out what is it that you\\'d like to get from confronting him. What I mean to say is to first understand if the confrontation doesn\\'t go as planned, what will happen to you then.  I see that you have identified two of such scenarios however there are various other possibilities too. Best scenario being- him accepting and apologising and worst being- him blaming  and gaslighting you. That can also impact you a lot so that\\'s there too. Hence, it\\'s important that you work through all these possibilities with a safe and trained person like a therapist and be prepared. \\n\\nMoreover, the traumatic memories are certainly something that you\\'d want to forget, however the tricky part is that trauma lives and is remembered by our bodies too. And hence, i suggest what people here and in the original post have done, asked you to speak to a professional therapist, better if you can to someone who is trained in this particular area of work.   \\n\\n>I\\'m conflicted because he is not a \"\"bad\"\" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult\\n\\nI get what you are saying here. You have met this person in more than one context. And have spent a lot of time and have good memories with them too. I think i am just repeating you here but yeah, people are not all good or all bad.  People do a lot of deeds which can have impact on others which can be good or bad. However, what happened was not okay. Please remember that. You can be their well-wisher and also feel a lot of hurt/ anger/hate towards them.  And also all these intense feelings can cause a state of complete confusion. It is complicated and hence I just want you to remember that whatever you feel is valid (till the time your feelings are not being manipulated by anyone else).  \\n\\nAlso, in general and not related to forgiving someone who has abused you,  i personally believe that forgiveness is something that can be very personal. It may also not require confrontation but just a release of all the negativity that comes along with that person and event. It can be a process and not a one-off incident. It can also involve forgiving yourself for what happened and for not being able to protect oneself. \\n\\nI have a suggestion for you, it\\'s a audio/podcast. It\\'s called \\'healing through letting go\\' by Sarah Blondin. I think it\\'s 15-20 minutes long. I think you may resonate with it. \\n\\nTake care, sending you peace and courage for whatever you decide to do. OP you could try exposing him but Indian parents mostly won\\'t give a damn about it. If you keep seeing him every family get together, your health will go for a toss. I would move out in this type of situations if nothing goes right. \\n\\n Considering the current situation, you must observe him. If he is a changed man then you should forgive him.\\n\\n And if not you should tell it to a close family member( which is close to you) and i think they will help you better.

You either expose him and shame him before family and get the release you need\\n2. take him aside and vent! Doesn\\'t matter if he admits or not, get the closure you needIrrespective of which option you choose, in the end forgive him and reduce / cut contact with him. Forgiveness doesn\\'t mean he was innocent or that he deserves it, it only means you choose to close the chapter and walk to a bright future ahead.

I know of people who joined at 32. Follow your dreams but lower your expectations overall. Life will surprise you constantly in a good way. For that you have to attempt the entrance exam NEET.\\n\\nA couple of years ago, they had issues a rule stating that there was an upper age limit of 25 for unreserved candidates and 30 for candidates with reswevations.\\n\\nHowever, that rule is challenged and until the Supreme Court passes a resolution, the upper limit is relaxed.\\n\\nThus, NEET guidelines, for now, is that there is no upper limit on age for attempts.\\n\\nAs for everything else?\\nOnce you get into MBBS, no one cares how old you are or what you do. You will still be ragged, it\\'ll still be books before social life. Hi, you will have to study and clear the NEET. NEET is very competetive. it has Physics Chem, Zoology and Botany.\\n\\nand hopefully get a govt. seat which is affordable. private colleges charge a LOT.\\nyeah I know of a few people who did B.E and then joined MBBS but they\\'re filthy rich and their parents are self sufficient and continue to support these guys. (they send a monthly allowance). I know of even one guy in his 40s but he was in a well paying job in a foreign country then moved back with his savings and his family lives with him while he goes to college.\\n\\nyou will have to study for 4.5 years, and do 1 year of paid internship.\\n\\nafter that you can apply for your state govt. rural position and they will take you in if they have vacancies (which I\\'m sure they do, but i dont know if you\\'ll get exactly where you want)\\n\\nBeware. It is a long and arduous path which will test the limits of your resolve. you need to remember a lot of things (although that is becoming easier with stuff like spaced repetition)\\n\\nyou seem like you don\\'t care about the money. A service candidate practicing in rural areas is paid around 40,000 I believe. just sharing for your benefit.\\n\\nI just want to give my 2 cents that it is sad your village people are dying, and it shows great heart in your intention to help them by becoming a doctor. however they are in this situation because of **Systemic** problems that not even many good hearted individuals like you can fix. the only solution is to expand funding for healthcare as a portion of GDP, hopefully coronavirus will push in that direction. also first talk to your local MLAs and MPs to establish clinics and all. that helps a lot more than going through NEET preparation and writing exams every 6 months in MBBS. some cities are actually sufficiently staffed with doctors, they don\\'t want to practice in rural areas because they are compensated extremely poorly for the effort and time and sacrifice of youth that went into MBBS and MD (8 years of studying, note that)\\n\\nagain, If you have a burning passion for medicine, go ahead. just know that this is the reality in front of you.

I am not sure about the Spanish teaching scene, but a quick look on [Naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/spanish-teacher-jobs-in-india) shows they don\\'t pay so much. So perhaps these institutes hire local spanish teachers. \\n\\nWhy don\\'t you try jobs at the Spanish embassy/consulates in India? They probably have a good demand for Spaniards who can speak English. 1.There are loads of opportunities for expats!\\n2. In terms of Spanish language teacher, there are opportunities in major Metros. There is also opportunities for teaching Spanish Cusine and dance. \\n3. In terms of HR in management, corporate culture varies in india which sometimes frustrates a lot of expats but there are many who thrive here also. It depends on the company and its work culture and where you fit in it.\\n4. My big concern if any to tell you is safety. Women\\'s security in India is not horrible but sketchy. It would be safe to intially travel with friends especially after dusk, and understand some safety measures and precautions first hand. Yes, absolutely, you can make a living over here and pretty much have a good life, more chaotic though.\\n\\nYou will catch the basic conversations in local languages over a period of time as you move around doing regular chores, which should be enough. Learning Hindi isn\\'t essential.\\n\\nEnglish would be more than enough in a business environment. \\n\\nDemand for Spanish teachers is something I can\\'t contribute to, Hyderabad has a foreign language university, which has Spanish as the 3rd most learnt language.\\n\\nYou are pretty well qualified to live a comfortable life here. All the best :) Hey,\\n\\nYes you definately can. And I particularly know an institute that is looking specifically for native Spanish speakers.\\n\\nThey are willing to pay a good salary too.\\n\\nGo to the website of this organisation called AIESEC. \\n\\nIt\\'s a non-profit that works to help students and young people get international internships and volunteering experiences.\\n\\nYou could look at the opportunities there and see which ones  you are interested in.\\n\\nAdditional you can also message me if you wish to come down for the opportunity I mentioned above, which is in the City of Chennai. > do you think I can make a living overthere? Do I need to learn Hindi?\\n\\nThere is lot of linguistic diversity in India. If you are going to Delhi or Mumbai, then it would definitely be easier if you learn Hindi. Atleast the conversational Hindi. \\n\\n> Can a foreigner who only speaks English work in a business environment?\\n\\nYes. Your work life should not be too much of an issue without the knowledge of Indian languages. It\\'s the simple things like taking a cab, buying groceries, etc. which require you to learn the local language.\\n\\n> Are demand for Spanish teachers?\\n\\nNot that much. Or atleast I am not aware of. Among the foreign languages, there is more demand for French, German and Mandarin as far as I know. First, promise me some home made tacos. Yes, you can come here. There is a learning curve to living in India, a huge one infact. But if you live in the major cities, you wouldn\\'t face a lot of issues atleast not languages based. You can pickup Hindi or whatever local language prevalent in the region soon enough. \\nYes, there have been issues with women safety and security in India as of late, but can you or anyone guarantee that females won\\'t face harassment or any similar issues in developed countries?\\nAnd regarding jobs, you can get them in major cities without a lot of hassle. By the way, you should come to India and live here for a year or two and then decide what you feel about this culturally vibrant country of ours, how about that, eh? Hey. India has so many lanuages that even learning Hindi won\\'t help you many states. So I\\'d say English is good enough to start. Most cities have a good number of English people and can help you with interactions with the non-English speaking locals. You\\'ll pick bits and pieces eventually.  \\n\\n\\nHR management has a good number of jobs with a lot of them being English speaking ones. So again, language or job prospects shouldn\\'t be a problem. I am no expert on Spanish related jobs but I still feel that you can get a job as interpreter or a teacher at a lot of places. ( few french teach here work at an institute called Alliance Francaise and may be there\\'s something similar for Spanish).  \\n\\n\\nApart from that, a few major cities are relatively unsafe for women. Also jobs wouldn\\'t be as paying and even the work at times is not that amazing unless you find a right job. Apart from that, make sure you learn a few techniques of what we like to call \"\"jugaad\"\" (basically life-hacks like bargaining, mode of travelling etc). Yes you can definitely work. Indians worship foreigners but why you want to come is the question. Nothing is up here. Don\\'t come. There\\'s 13+ major languages here, depending on the stage you go to.\", Froogler bluelappy84 None BaBaBlackshepp Fabulous-Rice AkashGvpta Masked96 DesiPattha psy_think up_for_adoption hurricane_news\\nPoorMansScoresse,1582418661.0,AskIndia,154,210,False,I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it; how can people with masters degrees and the ability for independent thought buy into this man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lunacy?,Why is Sadhguru so popular amongst India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s educated class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f81url/why_is_sadhguru_so_popular_amongst_indias/,\" Because guy speaks like some enlightened shit and also in fluent magical English. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople with masters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

He woos them with his pseudo intellectual mumbo jumbo and his ability to converse in english. People Just want to believe in somebody or something and he happens to fake a more dignified persona than the Asarams and Nityanandas. The exact same reason why the popular notion that being educated = being smart is propagated despite being a myth :) Just like Asaram got has his blind followers who still to this day believe that he isn\\'t a rapist nor his son, these educated class or whatever they are, Jaggi knows how to manipulate them with charlaton tricks, the oldest tricks in the bag. He is not the first in this business. It\\'s a worldwide phenomenon. You can find Jaggi kind of preachers all over the world who talks about some spiritual bullshit about visualize your soul. If  one has seen \\'The Mentalist\\' , you can see Malcolm McDowell\\'s character as a leader of a cult group called Visualize, plenty of super rich and corporates from all walks of life follows him blindly and protect all his whims and lavish life. He makes one believe that he knows all the truth about you which even you don\\'t know about yourself. And suckers go for it. Hence every con man famously said \"\" Sucker born every minute.\"\"\\n\\nOne can do anything they want to others, without fear of law, and Jaggi allows them to do it under his ashram. Ofcourse why he preaches is pretty much common to find in books. I work in an Indian company which is more than 100 yrs old and fortune 500. (Very few of them exist). \\n\\nOne of our past MDs from 80s and 90s period, who is considered to be the organization\\'s modern architect and who is revered by people for his attitude, scientific approach and wisdom, he is one of the foremost Patrons of Sadguru. I can\\'t wrap my head around it. He is being shown as a marketing tool as well to attract more industry personalities. I used to adore this guy since I have joined here because I have seen his work and heard him speak. \\n\\nSadguru sure has some Sacred Games level dope shit going around somewhere in his shrines. There is no other way this can be explained. U know just the same as some of the smart and educated people supported and bought into the development and growth model shit a few years ago (some still do)...more than anything else, I believe that people really fall for people who can talk smart even if it is just rhetorical and has no sense in it, commonly known as \\'***Framing Cognitive Bias\\'***...the fact that they are hearing it for the first time makes it all the more enticing..and smartness alone is not sufficient, you need time to think through and comprehend something...and most people do not want to spend their intellect on thinking about something that is accepted by like minded people which alludes to \\'***Confirmation Bias\\'..*** just like how people with masters and ability for independent thought buy into Modi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s propaganda. \\nTrust me they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the same people. what else will the upper middle-class do on weekends ?

She\\'s doing a disservice to all the other mothers of the country who actually need that maternity leave. The kid needs calm environment not the stressful routine of a bureaucrat\\'s life.\\n\\nAnd what if this lady cites her own example and forces people to work under her when actually they need to be somewhere else?\\n\\nNo way I\\'m going to consider her as a model bureaucrat. She\\'s like that kid in the school and college who will do whatever it takes to finish homework, come to the class even in floods and unnecessarily be the star-kid in the eyes of the teacher. I so don\\'t want this culture to be promoted. Not a good news, IAS officers come in daily contact with many people. I would worry about **three** people handling a baby daily in current circumstances. Doesn\\'t India have laws regarding paid maternity leave? Why would you come to your job with your child, especially in such times?\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but I find nothing praiseworthy here. Nice PR She still let photographers into her office to click this photo when it was not absolutely necessary , so how well is she protecting her baby again ? With the daily rise in covid cases which everyone knows can be deadly for infants and oldage... she\\'s bringing her child to prove what? She\\'s the only hardworking mother in this world? And what dafaq ppl congratulating her for? I am glad to find a lot of comments here calling her out. Even removing the dangerous situation she is putting her child in the current state of affairs, this is nothing praiseworthy or exemplary. Women who have delivered baby/had csection needs proper rest and recovery period. That\\'s why maternity leave exists. I had to go back to work at 12 weeks leaving my newborn to a care taker. I had to pump 3 times at office and still be productive as my male colleagues. After coming from office, I don\\'t have time to rest because I need to relieve the care taker and let her rest. I couldn\\'t sleep well, because baby needs to be fed every few hours through night as well. Then there is the overhead of cleaning and sterilizing bottles and pump parts. Delivery is traumatic. Csection is a major surgery. Women should be allowed to recover and dedicate their time to their babies before joining back to workforce. They will be more productive that way. Glorifying toxic work culture is more damaging than anything. I feel this is just a publicity gimmick!\\n\\nWhy is that so many IAS officers who are doing some incredible work (especially related to tribal people) are not publicised? Why are they not seen in trending news or searches? Wait, I thought maternity leave is compulsory. A female can waive the leave? While I\\'m impressed with her dedication, I agree with every other commenter. She is jeopardising the child\\'s life by coming in to work in this scenario. \\n\\nPlus, maybe I\\'m jaded but this feels more like a publicity stunt than anything else. Feel free to correct me. I\\'m a pessimistic person by nature and I feel like this is just a show to prove how \"\"work trumps all\"\" is her motto or whatever.\\n\\nBut on a cheerier note, congratulations on the baby. I wish him a healthy wonderful life. Any reason why her husband cannot take care of the child?

There is only one street in my town, where these people supposedly live. I have never met even a single Nihang in last 10-15 years\\n\\n\\\\- They are remnants of Orthodox Sikhism. No normal person would aspire to be part of them. In earlier Sikhism, they were one sect of traditional Sikh Warriors.\\n\\n\\\\- I guess modern day Nihangs are religious zealots/idiots who can\\'t fit into any other job or they were born into these sects. Or they maybe extremely poor people or orphans, Who might be recruited by sects/deras\\n\\n\\\\- They live in groups/deras and some of them live a Nomadic life\\n\\n\\\\- They defraud people (village people) ...Collect money from them and mostly spend money on their drugs and gaining more power for their idiotic sects.\\n\\n\\\\- I will stress this again  : - They are nothing but drug addicts as of now.\\n\\n\\\\- They don\\'t have any spiritual or moral standing among people of Punjab. Although Government won\\'t ban them or ask them not to carry weapons, but if it does, normal people won\\'t even bat an eyelid. It is a fringe sect that is obsolete Here is the video of the incident - https://twitter.com/AdityaRajKaul/status/1249205642239397889 [NSFW] So when UCC is passed.

He deserve strict punishment. None of the news channels are discussing it. There are no debates on the mentality of the Sikh community. \\n\\nNo, this incident does not reflects on the Sikh community. But neither do any of the incident reflects on the Muslim community.

However, with the sheer number of migrant workers, I wonder what solutions were feasible? Any arrangement of mass transportation, like train/bus services would risk infecting millions.

And then, this Tabliki Jamat incident came out and entire narrative shifted from \\'everyone against corona virus to \\'Indians against muslims spreading corona virus.  Videos(Some of it are true, others are not)  started circulating blaming it on Muslims to spread the corona virus in India. Terms like \"\"Corona Jihad\"\" were coined. News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India. Actions of few Muslim people (Incident in indore and tiktok video of a guy from Malegaon) gave it more fire. \\n\\nThis is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. Many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes I am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the Muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. Already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women. Once this corona virus fiasco is over, no one will pay attention to how Government failed it\\'s duty towards daily wage workers, health workers but this incident will be highlighted and it will be used for political gains. Life of ordinary Muslims in India who had nothing to do with Tabliki jamat will get screwed.\",[Hear me out] Tabliki Jamat incident has screwed ordinary Indian Muslim\\'s life for coming years,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fva7ot/hear_me_out_tabliki_jamat_incident_has_screwed/,\" [removed] One of friend when he called me told that India has fought the virus very well till know and except Muslims everyone is doing their patriotic duty by staying home ..\\n\\nMy father when he called, me told that Muslims are spreading the virus intentionally because they believe it is sent by Allah to kill evil forces, so they want to spread it everywhere according to their god\\'s wish.. [removed] Yeah why do you think news channels are barking like dogs over this incident? They have found the perfect scapegoat to cover Modi government\\'s incompetence and mistakes. I\\'m so tired of these media companies who have figured out what type of journalism gets the most TRP. We should boycott their sponsors but a lot of them are funded by politicians themselves which is really fucked up in itself. Muslim man committed suicide after villagers started abusing his family after police came to take his sample.\\n\\n\\nTest result came negative. What I see in social media is that the anger against the virus is getting channeled towards Muslims for the Delhi incident, Kejriwal for failing to prevent the Delhi incident, Kerala led by communist government for being the state with high number of initial cases imported from communist China and Islamic middle East and then spreading it all over India.. And ofcourse the usual suspects like Mamta, Rahul Gandhi, Ravish Kumar etc for criticising Modi and doing politics during such a time of war like crisis.. [removed] As a Hindu, the most I can say is - the liberal left of Indian society will fight on for your rights. How the first cases of the virus in India happen in the first place? I\\'m a Muslim Stuck in Goa, I mean every part of India is Blaming like ,\"\" Ye mullo ne case badha dia \"\" , ,\"\" Ye Nizamuddin mai joh Muslims haina unki wajhe se cases aaj itne zyada hogaye \"\".\\n\\nI know it\\'s not alright to organise this big event at this time but I\\'m 100% sure that at 10-15 march whole India were sleeping on this, It\\'s the responsibility of government that why they let this big event get organised at that time. \\n\\nBut, It\\'s like a dream for BJP to find people at Nizamuddin. They get people to put their blame on and cherry on top is that they\\'re muslim. So they\\'ll do whatever possible to frame it like we tried but see Muslims are bad so because of them it happens. \\n\\nIt\\'s a nice virus, If this government doesn\\'t do some good measures other than banging utensils and lighting dia and candles then I\\'m afraid what our future is going to be and I\\'m 100% sure that people will blame it all on Tablighi jamaat like it\\'s there intention to spread the virus in India. \\n\\nBack in 2015, I attended a conference of a Congress MP and I asked him a question regarding India\\'s future economy and where they see India at 2025, that MP clearly said that time ,\"\" Economy will do fine, It\\'s always on autopilot, we just need to check that it\\'ll stays on its path but I\\'m more concerned about our social democratic fabric as far as this government ideologies stays in the country, I\\'m bit concerned about our secularism until 2025 \"\" \\n\\nI thought that time that he\\'s just taking the hype nothing much but now as I saw it, This government never leave a chance to defame the Muslims of this country, not even a single chance, they\\'re create chances and find ways to defame a particular community of this country. Maybe I\\'m sounding too much but in past 3-4 days every other guy I talked to about corona brings Tablighi jamaat as the main reason for it, No sense in their talking, they don\\'t know what the desiese is from where it spread and came.

Over 1,000 people were injured.\\n\\nSome facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:\\n\\n1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.\\n2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.\\n3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.\\n4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.\\n5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.\\n6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings\\n7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.\\n8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Sikh festival.\\n9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.\\n10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.\\n11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.\\n12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.\\n13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.\\n14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.\\n15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.\\n16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations\\n17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.\\n18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920\\xe2\\x80\\x9322), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.\\n19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.\\n20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.\\n21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.\\n22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.\\n23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British\\n24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been \"\"confronted by a  revolutionary army\"\", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  \"\"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves\\n25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  \"\"unutterably monstrous\"\", while Asquith called it \"\"one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history\"\".\\n26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  \"\"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\"\"\\n27. After Churchill\\'s speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.\\n28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.\\n29. Colonel Michael O\\'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.\\n30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.\\n31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.\\n\\n# Shaheed Uddham Singh\\n\\n1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O\\'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940\\n2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment \\n3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O\\'Dyer.\\n4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940\\n5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:\\n\\n>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?\\n\\nSingh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).\\n\\n# Following his conviction, he made a speech\\n\\nwhich the judge directed should not be released to the press.\\\\[9\\\\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material\\n\\nHe started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:\\n\\n>\"\"I say down with British Imperialism.

All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .\"\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"\"I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  \\xe2\\x80\\x98We are suffering from the British Empire.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Udham Singh continued more quietly. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  \\n>  \\n>\"\"I am standing before an English jury.

We know what is going on in India.\"\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"\"You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  \\n>  \\n>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  \\n>  \\n>\\'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!\"\"  \\n>  \\n>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s table.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.

Separate TABS for Groups. People receive thousands of messages from groups and often important one to one messages are missed due to this. Many people often do not respond or response very late because this miss one to one chat\\'s due to large number group messages.\\n2. Admin ability to control messages in group. Admin ability to delete any messages in group.\\n3. Mute people in group. Often time particular aunties / uncles / few people keep spamming in groups.  Its very annoying reading same kind of messages from these people. We have aunty who keep forwarding political messages, one who keep posting environment messages, one who keep forwarding devotional messages and hence important messages are lost.  If we can just mute these people in groups, it will be amazing and will saves years of time for every one.\\n4.

That\\'s how building homes works in our country\",https://i.redd.it/mq3gokk3w0n41.jpg,\" I worked in a small construction company and everyday I will ask them to wear safety belt while hanging and drilling/painting outside the walls 3 storeys high. They won\\'t listen, I told them \\'no safety no work and you should quit\\', motherfuckers complained to the owner of my company and that fucking idiot gave me an earful, he said \\'What just because you are an engineer you are in some pedestal or something? this how India is, don\\'t think you are cool just becuse you have degree\\'. Idiot owner gets offended for asking people to adhere to safety.The guy drives a Audi and he dosent give a shit about their safety. Gives abysmal wage, don\\'t think it\\'s the minimum wage.But those poor construction guys just work, no shoes, safety belts, hard hats nothing. \\n\\nThey think having safety gear is not cool or hip. I even told I would buy with my own salary but these guys didn\\'t care.\\n\\n But not everywhere it\\'s like this, like the other comment said, big construction area\\'s will require safety standards to be adhered, if not they will not allow. The owners don\\'t want a legal case to filed against by labour court.\\n\\nI learned a lot about the way of life for those people, it\\'s like they don\\'t seem to value human life. It\\'s really sad actually. Working in that field became very clear how privileged I am, and the gratitude I felt for my parents (who were poor during growing up) for studying hard while growing up and giving me a good life. Safety is a western propoganda. there are few things that are cheaper in this country than life... This is equivalent of writing \\xe2\\x80\\x9com\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at start of answer sheet in exam. I get your frustration but the reality is a little more complicated. On major construction projects in the country, both government and private, safety practices are pretty good. I interned at the Statue of Unity project and have worked for a major private contractor in Gujarat and both places had very good health and safety practices.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the smaller contractors and smaller projects, the expense of hard hats, boots, glasses, fall protection, etc is way too high. In fact, I have seen on a very small project with a 10 person labor workforce where the owner offered to buy fall protection, hard hats, and boots for the workers and they blatantly refused because they are not comfortable at all in India\\'s extreme heat. They actually threatened to quit if any such compulsory requirement was put on them. The owner offered the workers to work 5am-10pm and 4pm-9pm instead of the 9am-7pm and even that they refused. \\n\\nI know, it\\'s crazy to put monetary value to life and safety, but there is no government mandated and enforced regulation for safety. So, the lowest bidder wins. As long as people are willing to work without protection and as long as the government doesn\\'t force it nationwide, there will continue being this issue of neglect. Safety gear and procedures are western constructs. Indian culture is where you say god\\'s name for protection and have a glass of gaumutra. ^(/s) I am a diy guy and I love watching such videos on YT. It\\'s always a difference to notice between the Indian and Videshi diy (mostly woodworking kinda stuff) videos. They\\'d be wearing safety goggles, helmet, field shoes, jeans, jackets, gloves - basically inside some army level armour using a benchsaw kinda thing to cut a stick and meanwhile, my *Bharatiya Shilpakaar*s will be wearing kachchas and cutting timbers with hacksaw that their carpenter forgot at their house. (Obviously a bit of exaggeration but some will definitely be able to relate to this.) A lot of Indians come to work in Nepal, mainly in construction, carpentry, metal sectors. And what really hurts is seeing little kids and young adults use heavy/loud tools, especially while drilling, sawing, or carving granite, marble etc. They work without protecting their ears and eyes. Every time I see someone being so careless, I try to make a point. Poor fellows simply don\\'t have any idea about the damages they incur without using noise cancelling headphones and other equipments. [removed] Sadly, life is a cheap commodity in India. There was a guy who was painting our house. There was a small bit left for which he said he\\'d do it after a few days. He didn\\'t show up after those few days. Yeah you guessed it right - he had fallen while doing another job and died. Just like that.

Don\\'t know about other cities but atleast in Bengaluru, please dont buy a car. BMTC is improving so is the bike rental convenience.\\n\\nEspecially if you\\'re a bachelor, Instead of spending 6+ lakhs on a car, you might as well spend a bit more on a flat/hostel closer to your workplace and walk.

Either you don\\'t go out much or you\\'re an NRI. Car is absolutely a necessity. A driver and a car is one of those luxuries that have completely changed my life for the better. I have a 45min to 1hr commute to work in horrible traffic and I already hate driving. Having a driver has allowed me to be calmer and more relaxed. I\\'m able to use the time in the car more productively and I dont have to worry about fucking parking. I don\\'t like smelly Ubers, broken suspensions, lack of seatbelts and safety, uncouth drivers and their antics everyday. Thank you but I shall have my car every day of the week. Context: first car was a Nano (still my favourite), then bought an Xcent CNG for long drives. \\n\\nI used to travel in Uber, Autos and buses (city doesn\\'t have metro). \\n\\nHaving a car is absolutely essential in India. Public transport is unsafe, unreliable and expensive. The cost per kilometer for even the cheapest Uber or Auto is more than Rs. 20 in my city, and I get a smelly car or auto with a rash driver.\\n\\nWhen I bought a Nano, it literally unlocked a lot of freedom for me. I could visit a movie with my friends without worrying about the 500 rs 1 way uber fare. I could pick parents from the airport. I could go on long drives without worrying about the crappy cars from Zoomcar breaking down. \\n\\nYes, I used Zoomcar till 2016 and I was utterly disappointed by the quality of cars. One EcoSport we rented had a BROKEN headlight dangling from the side, completely bald tire, and we paid more than 3500 for 1 day of driving. The car broke down mid way. I vowed never to use that service again. \\n\\nBuy a cheap car. Don\\'t spend a lot of money on it. Your friends may tell you that a 3 lakh bike looks sexier and you can do ladakh trips, but bikes are the most unsafe and uncomfortable means of transport in a nation with the highest road fatalities. Oh,about safety, almost all cars by Maruti are 0 rated for crash tests, so might as well buy a Nano. If not, get something from Hyundai or Tata or Mahindra, preferably used. \\n\\nThe cost of ownership of a car, including everything, for a 1 lakh kilometer ownership period, is around Rs. 10 per km. This is for a 7-8 lakh Rs. car on Petrol. On my Xcent, the cost of running is Rs. 3 per KM. That\\'s 7 times cheaper than the Uber fares without surge rates. There are a lot of intangible benefits that come from vehicle ownership including utility, convenience and transporting family and stuff in bulk. \\n\\navailability : try getting to work in an Ola or zoomcar on a rainy day. \\n\\nbesides there are a handful of sexual positions that are only possible in car ;) 2 wheelers don\\'t protect you from rain, sun and dust\\n\\nBooking Uber takes above 30 minutes and it runs at about Rs 40/km in Hyderabad. Struggling daily for 30 min just to book an Uber to/from office is sub optimal\\n\\nPooled transportation requires you to depend on someone else and/or the route means you often spend 20 min extra each way\\n\\nAt some point in life, it\\'s worth spending money on non necessities. Even if someone is spending a years salary on a car they\\'ll use for 5 years, it may be worth it for them. Live in Delhi, Metro works for me in 95% of the cases, rest I use auto or cab. So I basically have 0 need for a car. Cars or anything else, if you NEED it, you buy it. If you buy stuff without necessity, that person is dumb IMHO. Judging a purchase based on costs is not good.

My dad tells my mom not to be so religious atleast in social media where thousands of people will be viewing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of like her business number. My moms name sounds very much like a Muslim name so they decided to change it(not officially) to seem neutral to all religions. You ask why go to such extents, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a religion? My dad almost lost an event from a multi millionaire because his friends circle were Hindus and told not to organise event from us.

They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. \\n\\nWhen they\\'re not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG.

What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?\\n\\nAnd finally, how can Indian religions be reformed to make better humans out of us?\",Opinion: What\\'s the point of being religious if it doesn\\'t rid you of basic human vices?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funn5p/opinion_whats_the_point_of_being_religious_if_it/,\" They don\\'t connect religious tenets to daily behaviour. Each religion has a ritualistic aspect and a moral advisory aspect. It is common for people to focus on the former and forget the latter. This is because identifying with a religion no longer means following moral tenets. It means fulfilling the ritual aspects. This shift has occurred with the growth of population and religious propagation. Fuck every religion imma be atheists from now Let me step aside a bit and go on a tangent : The boon and bane with Indian religions ,at least with the collective we now term as Hinduism , is that there is no central authority or guiding figure .\\n\\nOfc , there are gurus for each sect which can sort of fulfill the gap and act as a potential figurehead , but since the religion is so diverse that people have been interpreting it in their own way. Heck sometimes even between families the customs vary greatly.\\n\\nAlso since there is no \"\"proof\"\" of eternal damnation like Abrahamic religions folk aren\\'t afraid of being judged. It is basically upto you to be good. Worse comes to worse they think they will born as a bug or something in the next round.\\n\\nComing back to the original question , religions can and will never get rid of Human vices, cuz that is what makes us humans. But it can keep it in check which almost all religions are advocating for  \\n\\nThe point according to the pooja practioner  is to keep the Gods happy and no matter what they do they will be forgiven, this seems to be a major trait in all religions.\\n\\nAs far as Indian religions are considered, they need to unify and get under a common umbrella, by unify I mean mentally and not only in FB groups  and spew venom over other religions. Cut the caste divide , intermarry ,blur it out. There are a lot of spaces for improvement, like the Sikh brothers, their sense of community is far greater than any other Indian religion. \\n\\nTake care of local temples , own them , make community participate etc . Give easily digestable forms of scriptures to the young ones, which gives them a sense of right and wrong from a ethical point of view and not a reward punishment view.\\n\\nHaving said all this, it is always difficult to contain what goes on inside a person\\'s mind when he is down or angry.

This country badly needs an atheist movement. To wash away the \"\"sins\"\" apparently... I think that religion often offers a kind of meaning to life, ( not a very strong argument)\\nAnd one of the comments said that we need an atheist revolution in India. A place where public life and religion are so intricately intermeshed into the public sphere, and it allows a person to self actualise in that condition many people are afraid to let go of their traditions.\\nMoreover, many people say that colonialism directly impacted the growth of religious sensitivities in India. After colonialism, Hindus and Muslim became much more conscious of their identities and began to formulate movements based on those identities instead of cultural and linguistic affinities. \\nSo it is not just restricted to the question of vices, I think it promotes certain values such as exclusion, \\nThe point then should be how are we able to regulate the religion so that it does not become unjust.

Seeing from the trends of my mock adv tests , I should be able to get into some core IIT if not the absolute best ones(Bombay ,delhi ). I also applied to some USA unis not that seriously as a back up option .But surprisingly got into Carnegie Mellon\\'s school of computer science (supposedly one of the top CS programs in the world ) . What do you think my decision should be ?\",Carnegie Mellon Vs IIT/NIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvvgvx/carnegie_mellon_vs_iitnit/,\" An undergraduate degree at CMU might set you back by at least $350,000 over 4 years. That\\'s almost 3 crores if you take the exchange rate to be 80 (which it will reach soon). You might get a chance to work in the US, or apply for a masters/PhD there. If you can afford the fees, that might be a good option. But remember that the average pay would be close to $60k in hand ($100k gross), which means that the payback will run into a decade, unless you manage to increase your salary substantially. Also, you never know what the visa situation will be like. \\n\\n  \\nCS at an NIT is also a good option. Much cheaper, and has a lot of brand recognition. \\n\\nCall me biased, but the best professionals I have interacted with have studied at an IIT- especially the older ones (Kharagpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Kanpur and Guwahati). **I\\'m not an IITan so don\\'t make troll posts stating that I\\'m being elitist.**\\n\\nI have done a PhD from a top university abroad, and even here, if you have a degree from an IIT, it really makes the bored professor smile in appreciation. The advantage of an IIT is that it has the best peer group you can get at your age. And these are the folks who usually get the top spots at graduate programs abroad. You may not get computer science, but you can try getting a minor in the subject and seek a job that\\'s into any field of applied engineering. \\n\\nA lot of people will tell you that IITs are hyped and low in ranking etc. Please understand that rankings are based on research output, the number of international students and professors etc. They are not based on student quality or jobs they get after graduation. Rich universities game the system, while those in developing countries like India suffer. \\n\\nAll in all, it is a good dilemma to have. Personally, I find it risky to spend 3 crores on an undergraduate degree. If you want to go to the US or EU or some other country, get a masters or a PhD from there after doing your UG from here. CMU. Hands down. \\nGreat school. You\\'ll have a great experience. \\nHowever, the program is intense. So just fyi. \\n\\nP.S: I got into BIT after 12th then dropped out after 2 semesters. Gave my SAT and went off to Michigan. If you can afford it, CMU. Otherwise IIT. Step1: Finance available- check.\\n\\nStep2: Curriculum\\n      CMU - https://csd.cmu.edu/academic/undergraduate/bachelors-curriculum-admitted-2018\\n        IIT B - https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/documents/btech2013Curriculum-after-ugpc-comments.pdf\\n\\nStep3: If you want to really learn the discipline of  Engineering go to CMU. As stated by experts the payback period is longer but you\\'ll know to tackle the top level problems. Your approach towards engineering problems will be much better when you join the industry.\\n\\n If you want to do more of traditional engineering and bag high package placements go to IITs.\\n\\nGood Luck. Academics wise, I would say it really shouldn\\'t make much of a difference for your UG degree. But the extra curricular activities, clubs, societies that any Western university provides are the real game changer. You\\'ll slog in IIT and CMU, but at the end, you\\'ll have accomplished more in CMU than in IIT.\\n\\nThe biggest issue with studying abroad is the expense, especially when it comes to USA. But if you get a scholarship, that should ease a lot of the burden. Carnegie Mellon any day, especially if you want to pursue AI/ML. The environmental exposure and peer group will be outstanding, some of the greatest minds across the world.  You kind of get this at IITs too but most students generally tend to slack off until they reach their penultimate years of Undergrad.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great ROI if you can afford it. If you do well and play your cards right at CMU it won\\'t be hard getting into top companies like FAANG or start-ups with high pay grade. Totally worth it over considering MS at CMU after IIT undergrad. Applying to Masters even through an IIT is very hard to get accepted, it will need a lot of effort on your side in terms of extra-curricular and research work.\\n\\nP.s: I\\'m an IIT undergrad currently developing my profile and aspiring to get into MS ML at CMU. Carnegie Mellon Since most of the iitians and nitians end up going abroad, I would say skip that step Completely dependends on what are your goals and ambitions but anyday CMU>>IIT\\'s CMU ranks 1^st in the world for its computer science program. Since, most of the IITians try their hard to get CMU for their MS, you are basically getting a head start. Also, you\\'ll not need require MS to immigrate as you\\'ll already be in the USA for 4 years.

It\\'s cheaper and you will be near your family. \\n\\nYou can save a lot. What are your priorities? From what you\\'ve mentioned it looks like lesser expenses. Bangalore is way more expensive to live. Having lived and worked at both places, Bangalore any fucking day! Noida is cheaper, Noida might have family. But the quality of work, companies, peer group etc. Bangalore beats the shit out of Noida. Also, less pollution, far better weather conditions, work environment, cosmopolitan structure etc. \\n\\nHowever if your family is near Delhi, Noida stay here as you are going to save more and can look after them Bangalore is pretty much the best city in India for an engineering job if you cannot find a decent job in your hometown.\\n\\n Traffic is screwed up, but if you live close to work, you can take care of that. It is expensive but there are ways to save if you want. \\n\\nWork life is screwed up too. I would choose Living close to your home over Bangalore any day if you have a decent job. Comparisons based on my limited experience across the two cities:\\n\\n* **Colleagues:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: *Generally* a very crass crowd, inconsiderate, boorish, non-diverse.  Office colleagues are combatant and passive-aggressive, constantly at each others\\' throats. This also extends beyond the workplace and applies to the general populace. Exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.\\n   * BLR: Generally a more refined, laid-back crowd, quite diverse. This also extends to the general populace, except auto-rickshaw drivers and drivers in general. Exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.  \\n\\n* **Jobs and Pay:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Very less options for switching. Pay upwards of 30L is hard to find.\\n   * BLR: Can switch every 6 months if one wants to. Pay upwards of 30L is a piece of cake (after a certain yoe).  \\n\\n* **Housing & Rent:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Lots of new apartments with great construction quality available at affordable rents. Impossible to find same brackets and similar value in Bangalore.\\n   * BLR: Quality housing is available but the inventory is smaller than N/G\\'s, and it costs a bomb. I\\'ve found that a kick-ass, shiny Gurgaon 3BHK which goes for INR 25k per month is INR 40-50k (at least) in Bangalore, for a similar or shittier apartment.  \\n\\n* **Transport, Roads, Traffic:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Better roads, better public transport, and even though traffic can get crazy, it\\'s not as bad as Bangalore\\'s.\\n   * BLR: Pathetic roads, brutal, never-ending congestion in places like Silk board, Varthur road, KR Puram flyover etc.  \\n\\n* **Food:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Great quality and variety of food. Tons of options, even in the sub <200 price bracket, there is great quality food available.\\n   * BLR: Not fit for human consumption, unless you are willing to shell out serious dough. I\\'ve found that quality food (beautifully prepared and true to the authentic cuisine, hygienic, perfect proportions and taste, generous quantity) begins above the INR 500 mark, sometimes more.\\n\\nI personally cared about peers (and thus office culture) and money a lot more, hence I prioritized 1 and 2 over everything else and worked towards fixing issues related to housing, traffic and food. Unless you get a 40-50 % increment, stick to Noida. How many years experience do you have ? \\n\\nBangalore definitely has better salary, more job options, etc. but has become extremely expensive to raise kids, run a big family, etc. Also the traffic is simply not worth all the extra money in my personal perspective. If you are looking for a short stint of 2-3 years as a bachelor it might work out, but you may not want to go out of Bangalore after that, however bad it is. The place has a magical quality like that, which is quite tough to get out of. Definitely Nodia. Because of the following reasons: \\n\\n- Better public transport (Delhi metro is world class and DTC buses are awesome. You can also go for e-ricks and autos are cheaper than Bangalore) \\n\\n- House rents are cheap, compared to Bangalore. And availability is awesome.\\n\\n- Winter in Delhi lasts from 2nd week of October to 1st week or April. That is 6 months of awesome, chilly weather. \\n\\n- Social life in Delhi pretty good and usually have more options than Bangalore.\\n\\n- Delhi has better access to green spaces and public parks. \\n\\nOn the contrary, here are some reasons I wouldn\\'t go for Delhi/Noida: \\n\\n- Despite 6 months of chilly weather, the other 6 months can be quite hot. Loo winds in May and June will raise temps to 45 - 50 degrees. July to September will be humid as fuck. \\n\\n- Pollution. Nothing to say about this.

Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. \\n\\n[India\\'s Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)\\n\\nGuarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power projection through it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. \\n\\n[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)\\n\\nIndian Navy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.\\n\\n[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)\\n\\nBut there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.\\n\\n1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. \\n\\n2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.\\n\\n3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. \\n\\n4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. \\n\\n5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. \\n\\n6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. \\n\\n7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. \\n\\n  \\n\\n[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)\\n\\nOne point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce\\xe2\\x80\\x99 modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. \\n\\nBut again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). \\n\\n[F\\\\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)\\n\\nOn the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. \\n\\n[JSDF \\\\(Japan\\\\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)\\n\\nNow it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.\",How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuv5y8/how_bout_quadnation_aircraft_carrier_for_ioc/,\" Japan is under US military umbrella, not to mention that US has bases in all these countries..they don\\'t need us. US Seventh Fleet operates out of Japan. Japan has large \"\"helicopter carriers\"\" which I\\'m sure can embark the STOL version of the F-35. \\n\\nSouth Korea comes under the US umbrella and can ask for protection at any time should they require it. \\n\\nAustralia also has a couple of Helo carriers they can embark the F-35 on. \\n\\nAll in all, the ultimate way to beat a Chinese naval force in those waters is not with the brute force if an aircraft carrier but with multiple sea denial actions wherein the Chinese carriers are not allowed to operate freely. \\n\\nFor example, patrolling the strait of Malacca effectivepy can quickly put an end to any ambition of putting Chinese carriers in the Indian Ocean. Which is why the base in the Andamans is insanely important. Also, many countries in that region are not that close to China. Should there be any aggression, you can almost guarantee support because they\\'re also in the line of fire. Don\\'t you think we need hospitals and schools/ colleges more than we need aircraft carriers? The military might of USA didn\\'t protect their population from unemployment, poverty or a dangerously stupid president elected by an illiterate & brainwashed voter base. Just consider onething: Our navy doesn\\'t need more than 3 carriers at all. 1 for east, 1 for west, and one of the three is always at maintenance. Carriers just don\\'t justify the cost that they incur. Carriers are good for offence, but what we are looking for is defence. If our carriers are anyways going to stay near our coasts during defence then why not launch plames from the coast itself.

Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:\\n\\nWhen a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.\\n\\n5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.\\n\\nChina can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.\\n\\nThe vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.\\n\\nThe most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.\\n\\nAn examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.\\n\\nHealthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.\\n\\nPre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.\\n\\nAge: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:\\n\\ntable placeholder \\n\\nRead: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.\\n\\nGender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.\\n\\nThe new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.\\n\\nSince the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. \"\"This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,\"\" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.\\n\\nOne of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.\\n\\nFinally, a few direct quotes from the report:\\n\\n\"\"China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.\"\"\\n\\n\"\"Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.\"\"\\n\\n\"\"COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.\"\"\",WHO findings after trip to China - 5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbxmmt/who_findings_after_trip_to_china_5_of_people_who/,\" I recently read that the hospital treating these patients in Wuhan had around 20 ECMO machines and many more ventilators. ECMO machines are like super advanced and super expensive. There may be less than 100 in all of India. Most govt hospitals face shortage of ventilators too (which is inferior to ECMO). India cannot manage those critically ill with this disease at all. If it hits India or Bangladesh the economies will take such a hit and the cost to human life will be in the tens of thousands if not millions.\\n\\nI hope the concerned authorities are doing everything they can to stop it from spreading in India. I may be optimistic here, but this virus has not spread (local spread, not people who have traveled from China and Europe) in warm weather countries and Southern Hemisphere. I don\\'t want to jinx it, but viruses usually die, or have shorter lifespans when exposed to higher temperatures. Also, clusters in Southern Spain and South Italy (that have warmer climate at this time of the year) are smaller than near the Alps, Korea and China. I feel there are more cases of Coronavirus in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and Philippines than what we know but it is either spreading very slowly or not spreading due to the temperatures. I was planning a trip to Himachal Pradesh between March 7 and 14. Does this mean that I should not? The main reason for lab testing patients with just fever is to detect the mildly infected and their contacts and isolate and quarantine them respectively thereby slowing the infection rate.\\n\\nThis I hear is to spread the infected over time curve\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peak over as large a time period as possible so that hospitals can handle the load of severe and critical patients without running out of resources like ventilators and doctors. If the peak is over a very short time period then severe and critical patients will flood the system leading to a high cfr not just for covid but also for other diseases whose patients will have to share the high hospital load with the covid patients.\\n\\nIt is like with aggressive testing and quarantining they are pausing/slowing the infection while they deal with critical cases and empty the beds for new patients.\\n\\nThis manner of aggressive testing of all pneumonia patients with no travel history is about to start in the USA. It seems only patients with a travel history are being tested in India?? We are already fucked \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x9f ...

Damn! These south Indians always get the good things! /s This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. \\n\\nUnless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. \\n\\nWhen free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. \\n\\nHealthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. \\n\\nOur tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. \\n\\nBut our political class does not have such a vision. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all a pipe dream. The even bigger concern when we see only 3~4% of Indians pay taxes. Even though I assume the bottom 50% are tax exempted as their income is very less. The rest 50% should not be tax exempted. Government has always sided with the rich: the reason is two-folded - One, this way the top 10% support the government which in turn causes a huge influence base and Second, once the top 10% support, they are willing to shell some money to the parties as well which is also beneficial for them. Solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. That way, wealth can be accurately measured. But however, there is doubt if any ruling party would take such a step as this would hugely affect their popularity and funds. [deleted] The more I look at the infographic, more puzzling it becomes.

We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 \\xc2\\xb0C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. \\n\\n\\nLeave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species.

It often occurs when a large number of people watch the same TV programmes while taking advantage of breaks in programming to use toilets and operate electrical appliances, thus causing large synchronised surges in national electricity consumption. Electricity networks devote considerable resources to predicting and providing electricity supply for these events, which in the UK, for example, typically impose an extra demand of around 200\\xe2\\x80\\x93400 megawatts (MW) on the National Grid. Short-term supply is often obtained from pumped storage reservoirs, which can be quickly brought online, backed up by the slower fossil fuel and nuclear power stations. The largest ever pickup was on 4 July 1990, when a 2800 MW demand was imposed by the ending of the penalty shootout in the England v West Germany FIFA World Cup semi-final.[1][2] In addition to pickups, the Grid also prepares for synchronised switch-offs during remembrance and energy-awareness events.\"\" ELI5 why would grid fail if all the electricity is shut off?\", 42err india_ko_vanakkam wewillalldiesomeday narki-kameena indi_n0rd Dead-Shot1 Dialup1991 pgidoc miew09 insanegenius iphone4Suser\\n91uwu,1586150271.0,Politics,190,1688,False,,\"COVID-19: Man posts \\xe2\\x80\\x98no ventilators in Ludhiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on Facebook, booked for sedition\",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/covid-19-man-posts-no-ventilators-in-ludhiana-on-social-media-booked-for-sedition-6348963/,\" >In its official FIR briefing, Ludhiana police said that the man had been booked because he \\xe2\\x80\\x98created panic, tried to mislead administration during lockdown, and attempted to create a feeling of hate among common people towards the government.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It\\'s hard to believe that there are no ventilators in Ludhiana.

This is the true ANTI-NATIONAL threat our country faces. Wake the fuck up and smell the coffee people. We are in the midst of two pandemics. A viral and a social. Remember. BJP hates Dalit rights activists. Because Dalit votes comes cheap and in massive numbers. I did some quick search and found out that the crime he committed was comparing Modi to Hitler.\\n\\nIs there more to this story? >\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMayavi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Hindu mythology refers to a demon meant to be destroyed. When I was illegally arrested by the Pune police while still under the protection of the Supreme Court, a cyber-gang of the Hindutva brigade vandalised my Wikipedia page.

I remember a petty tampering incident: they tampered Utharakhand flood news removing Kerala\\'s contribution from it to push the narrative that one shouldn\\'t help dying people during then ongoing Kerala floods. In democracies, there will be always laws like UAPA that allow people to be arrested without conclusive proof and proper justice. Other laws like the \"\"sedition law\"\" are vague and often contrarian to the \"\"freedom of speech\"\" right. Even Congress(I) has been guilty of misuse of such draconian laws. Till such laws are in place, government/politicians will work to use it to silence people they don\\'t like.\\n\\nThe people should fightback against them, especially the literate amongst us.

What they need is democracy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and India should learn this lesson.,https://theprint.in/opinion/china-blunders-wuhan-should-settle-debate-democracy-economy/397968/,\" Authoritarianism never works. Whether it is with our own children or with the economy, it always messes things up in the long run. It\\'s sad that our supreme leader wants to bring the same level of censorship and outright authoritarianism that China has, but without the economic growth. The worse part is that if you ask an average middle class Modi supporter  Indian about this, they\\'re quite happy with their guy subverting democratic institutions in our country. Well, as a democracy, the US completely screwed up the response, including \\n\\n1. A president that took no action for 2months despite grave warnings\\n2. A federal government that  actively prevents states from getting the support they need\\n3. Senators selling their stocks using insider information while telling the public that everything is fine\\n4. Hospitals (they\\'re for profit) operating at such a lean (cost avoidance) level, that they can\\'t sustain even modest increases in patients, let alone a pandemic\\n5. People going bankrupt due to health care costs and job loss\\n\\nSo while I do not like the Chinese dictatorship, we shouldn\\'t pretend that a capitalist democracy is some magic way of proper government. My hope is that India learns from both countries and comes out of this stronger and wiser as a nation. This pandemic has brought about a lot of ill-will for China. I think India should use this as an opportunity to present itself as an alternative to China as far as manufacturing is concerned. I am pretty sure that a lot of corporations would be looking at supply chain alternatives in case similar events happen in the future. India should strike while the iron is hot The wet markets in China are in fact legal, not illegal like it is stated in the article. They were made legal in the 80s to combat lack of food, but it has become a luxury now.  China is now making a decision to change those laws. China doesn\\'t care. \\nStop buying that Oppo or or Xiaomi phone, that MG Hector SUV, and then maybe they will. There a nations with democracy, who had sufficient warnings & still managed to mess up.\\n\\nSure you may blame China to react how most nations would behave when faced with a sudden crisis. But you gotta hand it to them for bringing it to control (within their borders) so fast. China will always be the elephant in the room for India.\\n\\nTwo massive populations next door to each other will always mean a head on collision into the near future. That\\'s not the reason the virus spread to the rest of the world though. It\\'s a highly contagious disease. It spread really fast before anyone could figure out how serious it was. Even if they\\'d been transparent, they\\'d have slowed it down at best.\\n\\nSure, that may have saved lives, and for that you can blame China and several other countries for not taking it seriously. But we couldn\\'t have totally stopped it. Problem is people of India think too highly of their flawed democracy.\\nPraising India\\'s democracy is just another way of justifying cruelty of BJP government at center.\\nSilent majority of poor people in India suffers every day and people who praise this democracy are big reason for their suffering. If this pandemic started in India it would\\'ve been a lot worse due to India having less capacity for PCR testing than China, as well as less of a capacity for lockdowns and contact tracing. There were 50k cases in Wuhan alone officially and possibly up to 500k if you don\\'t believe Chinese numbers. How many would there have been in Mumbai if it started there? While authoritarian China did make mistakes, let us not forget that many democratic governments dealt with the crisis even worse than China. \\n\\nYes, things could have been better if there was more transparency and freer press on China. But we supposedly have all those things in Italy, in UK, in the US, and yet their governments were refusing to react even after it became clear that there was going to be a pandemic. There had been enough information coming out of China by mid January for the rest of the world to act. Yet, they didn\\'t. Why?\\n\\nChina is an easy target, but blaming only them deflects from the most fundamental reason for the failure to stop this pandemic.\\n\\nThe world failed to stop the virus because  of the blind race towards economic growth that we are so beholden to in our capitalist societies. The world was to afraid to to take steps that would cut the profits of large companies until it had no other choice left. That is why we failed to stop this pandemic.

Mainstream media has no agency; it shows only what sells. If the people in a capitalistic-democratic setup like being fed fake news and communal hatred, then the media will naturally capitalise on it. Media is simply a reflection of the society, and not the other way around. So, instead of putting the blame on media, ask why the demand exists in the first place. Nobody watches a video clip or a TV program and turns into an extremist. There are many more factors at play.\\n\\nEdit: Downvoting is okay, but I\\'d actually like to hear your views on why do you think that the media should be blamed. Except incase of our people, nothing is flushed and drained out. All is accumulated in their tiny empty brain. [deleted] Taking buttface to a whole new level This is the increasingly the case everywhere. The problem is inherent in human psychology. If anyone takes a bit of trouble of reading up on behavioural economics (Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kanheman is a great start), you\\'ll know that humans are anything but rational. People, even after getting PhD\\'s get easily manipulated by framing effects, priming, anchoring. It is also a fact that the more you repeat propaganda the more the public believes something. All these, along with the fact that the information age has given people an access to too much information which they again can never take the time of verifying leaves a lot of room for manipulation. \\n\\nAlso the simple fact is if you\\'re driven by money, the easiest thing is to pertain to these bugs in human thinking. Add dramatic background music and yell and try and stir up a conflict between religious, political groups and people will tune in. The whole dynamics of the media will be against you if you\\'re trying to do \\'real journalism\\'. I could go on but no one will read this anyway perhaps. \\n\\nThere\\'s no solution to this. It is human nature. Unless you also want to give a government the power to decide what can or can\\'t be shown, fake news will spread faster than real news...toxic debates with logical fallacies will get more audiences than a more academic debate where both sides try to actually have a conversation. All I can say is read, read as many books as you can. Humans hugely overestimate their decision making abilities and how much they know. It is possible to at least reduce your ignorance the more you read.

Who owns that company and how much electoral bond did they buy? > Chaos is a ladder. Is it just me or the thread is blowing it out of proportion? Those kits by the Gujrat company are US-FDA approved while rest are not. Also the guidelines can be changed anytime. In the time of crisis why not go with the already tested kits If anyone thinks that this government is not corrupt, then you are an idiot.\\n\\nI know for a fact that the promoter of Siyaram Silk Mills paid an actual 50cr bribe to Amit Shah after his company was embroiled in a customs duty evasion scam.\\n\\nBasically they were importing material from China and mislabelling it to reduce their liabilities.

Congress - Scams in private and gets fucked.\\nBJP - Scams in public and nobody cares. Need more details on which are those banks and who are the lenders This isn\\'t exactly surprising. The write-offs have increased in recent times because of the basic tenets of economic system, i.e. it is going to be as good as the humans.\\n\\nIdeally, when you borrow $100 today and promise to repay it on a given date a year later (with interest), you are essentially asking your future self (of 1 year ahead) to reduce his expenses by $100+interest in order to increase your expenses by $100 today.\\n\\nThe debt taken can be classified in two major ways\\n\\n1. Debt to fuel productivity e.g. a loan to buy a truck that increases your productivity, making it easier to transport things in turn increasing your income, making it easier to repay.\\n2. Debt to fuel overspending e.g. a loan to buy TVs, ACs and everything else that you cannot afford, this debt doesn\\'t increase productivity or income and just consumes it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re undertaking first kind of debt, your future self will feel it easier to repay since his income would have increased because of this debt, but in case of the second kind of debt, your future self will not get any ease in repaying since his income haven\\'t changed because of the undertaken debt. **And therefore the premise, not all debt is bad, just the once that don\\'t increase productivity are.**\\n\\nHumans being humans are always susceptible to corruption, if I have $100, I might go get a book on cybersecurity OR I might go to an IMAX movie show.

Over the time, due to interest piling up and incomes not increasing much (because you didn\\'t use the debt to make yourself more productive), people were unable to repay their loans and then the defaults started.

A party which is using this virus to spread it\\'s communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath.

A society that is so frayed that the government doesn\\'t command universal trust like it did earlier.\\n\\n\\nDr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly.

We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn\\'t happen either. \\'\\n\\n>\\xe0\\xa4\\xae\\xe0\\xa5\\x81\\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\xb6 \\xe0\\xa4\\x94\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0 \\xe0\\xa4\\x89\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8\\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xa5\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xaf\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b\\xe0\\xa4\\x82 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b \\xe0\\xa4\\x89\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa5\\x8d\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\x96\\xe0\\xa4\\x82\\xe0\\xa4\\xa1 \\xe0\\xa4\\xaa\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xb5\\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x80 \\xe0\\xa4\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa4\\xac\\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b\\xe0\\xa4\\x82 \\xe0\\xa4\\xa8\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\x85\\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa4\\xae\\xe0\\xa4\\xa6\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xac\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xa6 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xac\\xe0\\xa5\\x88\\xe0\\xa4\\xa0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe \\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b \\xe0\\xa4\\xb2\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xaf\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe \\xe0\\xa4\\xb2\\xe0\\xa5\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa4\\x89\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa5\\x8d\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\x96\\xe0\\xa4\\x82\\xe0\\xa4\\xa1 \\xe0\\xa4\\xaa\\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa5\\x81\\xe0\\xa4\\x82\\xe0\\xa4\\x9a\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xaa\\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa4\\xb2\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa5\\x80 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\x85\\xe0\\xa4\\x82\\xe0\\xa4\\xa7\\xe0\\xa5\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa5\\x87 \\xe0\\xa4\\xae\\xe0\\xa5\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\x82 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x80 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b \\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\x9c\\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x8d\\xe0\\xa4\\xa5\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xb8\\xe0\\xa5\\x80 \\xe0\\xa4\\x95\\xe0\\xa5\\x8b \\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xaf\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xa3\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe \\xe0\\xa4\\xae\\xe0\\xa5\\x87\\xe0\\xa4\\x82 \\xe0\\xa4\\xb9\\xe0\\xa5\\x80 \\xe0\\xa4\\x89\\xe0\\xa4\\xa4\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa4\\xb0 \\xe0\\xa4\\xa6\\xe0\\xa4\\xbf\\xe0\\xa4\\xaf\\xe0\\xa4\\xbe\\xe0\\xa5\\xa4 \\n\\nInstead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway.

Maybe they secretly think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a gaddar too. \\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but I cannot till lockdown is lifted. Now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m feeling so trapped and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disturbing my mental peace. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day. Any advice on how to stay sane will be helpful.\",What do you do when your own family subscribes to the \\xe2\\x80\\x98goli maaro\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ideology? [rant],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwdgbn/what_do_you_do_when_your_own_family_subscribes_to/,\" Try this: Find Muslims figures that all Indians love - musicians, movie stars, cricket players, abdul kalam, top army generals, etc. \\n\\nStart bad mouthing them. Say how the army general is a traitor for being willing to die for his country. How Abdul kalam was a traitor for building the missiles. etc. etc. \\n\\nSee how they react. Hopefully you can confuse them enough to start thinking for themselves.\\n\\nEdit/add: this is not a problem you should run away from. You have to fight, cleverly, and win. Otherwise the whole country is at stake. You have to take them on, use your brain. Ask them which one of them is ready to do it and whats stopping them.\\n\\nI call this the Veer Savarkar model of bravery: keep up the fear-mongering and hate waiting for some numbnut to do the deed on their behalf. Don\\'t take their talks literally, but try to enjoy the silliness, to add to the fun, you should ask much more sillier questions related to these topics which would make them feel important, and then go back to your room and have a laugh. Run as far as possible and life your life on your own terms. You can\\'t change them. But you can change your situation. Assuming they won\\'t kill you while you are asleep, your best tool to get around, in this case, is sarcasm. The interesting thing about sarcasm is that it lets you vent out without an open confrontation. Once lockdown is over let us know here that you made it back to your place alive! Bro CUT THE CABLE My mom was on the verge of becoming this due to WhatsApp. The method I used is to react to her arguments with dry sarcasm that makes her look like a fool. When she felt embarrassed she\\'d ask my take on it and I\\'d explain. Boomers have high ego and won\\'t admit that they are wrong, the only way to get them to drop this bs is by making the said ideology appear beneath them. Argue with them, and make it clear I\\'m not backing down. \\n\\nAs for you, calm yourself. Ignore them when possible, or use below the belt jibes to keep them off centre.\\n\\nRemember. It\\'s not about being right. It\\'s about showing dominance. So you just have to make them feel not in control. Good to know at least 1 person in your family is sane. Hopefully the rest will come around over time. I wish you all the best Bro, I had a similar discussion with my family and I already told them..... You go your own way and I my own, if religion and Modi is above basic human decency for you, you may as well consider your son a Muslim \\n\\nSince that day, they call, I inform them I am good and that\\'s it. No talk and excuse me, but I have things to do.\\n\\nSame for my relatives, I have stopped interacting with religious fanatics and modi bhakts. I used to ignore my dad, but now my sister and mom have also joined the hate mongering. So, now \"\"I am good, had my food and I am busy\"\" This will fizz out on it\\'s own once the lockdown ends. No one will have time to watch news this much then. This is just a phase. Focus on ghar ka khaana and other positive things. Your folks are still the same people. They\\'re just impressionable.

We are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in India. \\n\\n>The world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus and India is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. I must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. \\n\\n>It is critical for us to understand that India\\'s conditions are unique. We may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the Covid-19 virus. \\n\\n>It is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.\\n\\n> Millions of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. This will result in a catastrophic loss of life. \\n\\n>We must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. The financial package announced by the government is a good first step. But speedy delivery of the package is important. Please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. Large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. It is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. At the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spread in order to contain it. \\n\\n>The government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. Thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. It is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. Factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. They are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. They are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. It is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. \\n\\n>It is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. Our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. It is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. \\n\\n>We stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge. \\n\\n>With best wishes, Rahul Gandhi\\n\\n[Source: Times of India](https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1244189233809481728)\",\"Full text of Rahul Gandhi\\'s letter to PM Modi calling for a \"\"nuanced approach\"\" to the lockdown\",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frkhq3/full_text_of_rahul_gandhis_letter_to_pm_modi/,\" Modi: well now i\\'m not doing it Recently reviewing all of Rahul Gandhi, he\\'s beginning to come off as an absolute non-Pappu.

It still doesn\\'t make any sense that the larger part of the Fund had to be crowdfunded when the company could take care of the whole amount and more while barely taking a hit.\\n\\nRetaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. This means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SALARY while acting like caring, charitable employers.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t even talk about the CEO forgoing an entire year of his salary. When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap PR bullshit. And let\\'s not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.\\n\\nTldr; fuck you Ola, we got bills to pay too.

And I say all this without bias. I\\'m no fan of Ola. I wouldn\\'t take their rides even if they offered me free service.\\n\\n1. Ola had 15 lakh drivers as of 2019. Even if it were to give everyone just Rs 2,000 as a one-time gesture, that\\'s 300 crores. I guess most would agree you need, at the very least, Rs 5000 to get thru this period. That\\'s 750 crores.\\n\\n2. So whether they donate 20 or 50 cr, it doesn\\'t matter. If you were Ola management, you\\'d want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you\\'re going to run short. I\\'d appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers, instead of bashing such moves.\\n\\n3. Don\\'t forget that they are ultimately a loss-making entity (losing more than 2000 crores every year). They\\'re not raising VC money to channel it all to charity. And, like other comments have mentioned, they don\\'t even have adequate cash in the first place. Valuation != cash in hand. Do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers? Why?\\n\\n4. Ola\\'s top management has already taken salary cuts, with the CEO letting go of his entire annual salary. Yeah you could argue it\\'s no biggie as he\\'s still filthy rich. But so what? What more do you want them to do? And why, in the first place? \\n\\nSo why is this surprising? Are you new to capitalism? \\n\\nAlso\\n> When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country \\n\\nu wot m8? Chutiye.. Valuation is not cash on hand. daily reminder that valuation doesn\\'t mean cash in hand.

Anyone who posts stuff like this should be made to take a course in basic corporate finance. Lol this is very Whatsapp uncle finance logic. Valuations are used to get more funding, and then they burn through that, only to come up with a higher valuation next time for higher funding. It\\'s a vicious cycle. Ola and such companies can never be profitable with the same approach, they\\'re just going down a path of no return and making as much as they can in the process. The tenet of business is the same today as it was a 100 years ago: You go on spending more than you earn, the bubble will burst and you\\'re going belly up. No exceptions.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called inflation.\\n\\nSo, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.\\n\\nSo, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.\\n\\nWe will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:\\n\\n1.\\xc2\\xa0Share Market\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nI just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .\\n\\nJust search in google : reliance share price\\n\\nAt that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.\\n\\nCompany list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.\\n\\nThe broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.\\n\\nFor example zerodha, they are India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest share broker -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. \\n\\n\\n\\n2.

So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.\\n\\nThey are of different types:\\n\\ni. Equity Mutual fund:\\n\\nEquity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.\\nThere are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.\\nA index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.\\n\\nIf someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.\\n\\nii. Debt fund:\\nDebt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.\\n\\niii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.\\n\\nFor a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.\\n\\nThere are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free and direct.\\nYou can sign up and use the app to buy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy.\\n\\nYou may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\xc2\\xa0Insurance\\xc2\\xa0:\\nInsurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:\\n\\ni. General insurance\\nGeneral insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like\\n\\nFirst party \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid\\n\\nThird party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid\\nThese are compulsory in india.\\n\\nii. Life insurance\\n\\nLife insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.\\n\\na. Health Insurance:\\nHealth insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense\\n\\nb. Term Insurance:\\nTerm insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you .

What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money \\'saved\\' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  \\n     \\nWhen you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is \\xe2\\x82\\xb920000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than \\xe2\\x82\\xb960000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about \\xe2\\x82\\xb91L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      \\n\\nCredit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was \\xe2\\x82\\xb91L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you\\'d owe about \\xe2\\x82\\xb91,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you\\'re under extreme financial duress and absolutely can\\'t make your card payments, I\\'d wager that you\\'ll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.\",PSA: Don\\'t opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don\\'t do it for your credit cards,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,\" I\\'m doing the exact opposite - getting some money from savings and quickly closing my credit card bills asap. I can pay debts now, no guarantee how the economy will look after 3 months. Is the moratorium automatically applied or do you need to choose it somewhere. Because I don\\'t need a moratorium This its another master stroke by RBI to pull in funds if you have crossed the half way mark in your loan tern - then delaying the 3 months of EMI is a good thing. \\n\\nhowever, if you are in the first half of your loan term - it\\'s not really worth the effort. What if you use the moratorium to keep some cash and once the situation improves pay it back as a bulk amount.

That\\'s why menstrual leave for women would not be helpful it will only increase discrimination and give another excuse for corporations to not take them for jobs.

If you ever worked in a startup, you know how much is the work pressure, usually, women hardly prefer to join. They join marketing or product management. Another thing, why force a cash crunch company to pay for maternity? Equality doesn\\'t work if you shove everything in our throats. If the startup succeeds, it can create many jobs. \\n\\nWomen leave the workforce because of family commitment, they do that in western countries too. You just can\\'t keep your family happy and have a successful professional life. It\\'s easy to blame the employer and say how sexist they are when it comes to hiring.

They should also bear the cost; at least partly for the women who do avail the break.

While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of Adversity comes Opportunity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Home\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Real Estate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Long Term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssured\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wealth Building Asset with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPredictable \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPredictable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssured\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Capital Appreciation in long term**, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price or your bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelps you Raise Money Quickly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWine and Real Estate improve with Age\\xe2\\x80\\x9d** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **Co-living market** size across India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India\\'s first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb7 India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why \\xe2\\x80\\x93**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer\\'s assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**\\n\\nThoughts Compiled By : \\n\\nDheeraj Kochhar\\n\\nCapitor Ventures Pvt Ltd\\n\\nNavi Mumbai\\n\\nReferences : \\n\\nAnarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers\",ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,\" Okay. Cigarettes are 45 a piece here. Can\\'t afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter\\'s market.\\n\\nBuying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.\\n\\n1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) \\nI\\'m\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) \\n\\n\\n\\n3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. \\n\\nSo expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . \\n\\n\\nA large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. \\n\\n\\nWe are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions \\n\\nPSA : Stay away from this wall of text put up by OP !!!!! \\n\\nReal estate is the last thing a smart man should be looking at for the next 15-24 months. \\n\\nPark your savings in easily liquifiable and safe investments for the time being.

This will be my first job in India and I have some very basic questions:\\n\\nI am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - I have been offered a base salary and along with that I get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.\\n\\n1. For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?\\n2. Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?\\n3. How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?\\n\\nBasically trying to understand how much I can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account\\n\\nThanks!\",Moving back to India - salary breakdown question,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ft2tfm/moving_back_to_india_salary_breakdown_question/,\" > For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet\\'s assume your HRA component is 3 lakhs. At the start of the financial year/ whenever you join a new company, you need to declare what you expect to pay as rent. For example, you may say your rent is 20000 \\\\* 12 months = 2.4 lakhs. \\n\\nThe company will pay you the entire HRA amount every month (3 lakh/ 12 months = 25000/ per month.) But since you declared rent of 20k only the company will consider only 20k as tax exempt and the will deduct tax on the remaining 5k.\\n\\n(There are some other rules around how much HRA is tax exempt, google it to know more.)\\n\\nIf you declare that you pay no rent, you will get 25k minus whatever tax slab you fall in.\\n\\nIf you declare your rent as exactly 25k, you will get the whole amount. But near the end of the financial year, your company will ask for proof of rent. You will need to submit rent receipts signed by your landlord along with his PAN number. If you do manage submit the receipts, then everything is great. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t the company will consider your entire HRA component as taxable, and deduct tax from that month\\'s salary in one go. Which is why it is better to be as realistic/ truthful as possible, else you might find yourself getting a fraction of your salary during the last month of the FY.\\n\\nSo to answer your question, the HRA money is paid to you, the only thing is how much tax is deducted before it is paid out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI assume that the \\'special allowance\\' you refer to is is the component over and above your basic + HRA. If yes, then you don\\'t need to do anything to claim it. It will be paid to you every month minus tax.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot sure what you mean by vehicle allowance. \\n\\nIf by internet allowance you mean the telephone reimbursement then the process is this - every month/ quarter, your company will ask you to submit your telephone bills. If you do submit the bills, you will get the reimbursement along with your salary - this is tax exempt till the amount of bills you submit. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you don\\'t submit any bills, you will get the amount as a lumpsum at the end of the year, minus tax. (this is what I\\'ve usually seen) IMO, Indian companies break-up salaries into different components in order to:\\n\\n\\n1- compute taxes easily, and \\n\\n2- to minimise some costs like PF, gratuity, etc. \\n\\nSince u/georgecostanza9 has already explained point 1 in detail, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explain the second.\\n\\nThe Indian Provident Fund (PF) rules dictate that *12%* of your *Basic Pay* will be deducted and paid into a sort of account maintained by the government. This money currently earns an interest of about 7% (down from over 8% last year).\\n\\nIn addition to your 12%, the company also is required to contribute an equal/equivalent amount, which is also deposited with the government as part of your PF. This component may be detailed in your salary as \\'Employer\\xe2\\x80\\x98s PF contribution\\'. Note: This so called contribution from your employer will not be paid to you, and should therefore not be included in computing the amount you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d receive at the end of the month.\\n\\nNow, in order to pay a smaller \\'Employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Contribution\\', companies tend to offer a smaller salary component called \\'Base Salary/Pay\\'. \\n\\nIf the other \\xe2\\x80\\x98allowances\\' were to be included as part of one inclusive salary package, both yours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 12% PF deduction/contribution would e higher. For a simpler calculation... If your salary is above 20L then you get between 20-25% deducted as tax and other prerequisites.. So about 75-80% will come as in hand every month... From the tax components... You need to put it in various schemes and et all to save on tax... So that\\'s a hassle i dont think a new person wants to get into esp since the 1.5 lakh limit gets very easily exhausted and the HRA exempt is on actuals... So unless you have a home loan on your account.. You dont have much you can do there\\nOn the 75% ish you get in hand..  Will be what you get paid and is post tax..  So if you are getting paid X annually..  A simplest tool is to do (X/12)*75% as your actual in hand salary...

None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.\\n\\nI think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination.

I\\'m sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.\\n\\nEither Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.\\n\\nBut the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. \\n\\nAlso PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.\\n\\nhttp://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Finance_commission This just sounds like bullshit based on limited understanding on so many levels. Let me tell you a few reasons why this simply cannot be true:\\n\\n1) Let\\'s say the disaster was limited to Delhi. Would they still give money to everyone - all states but Delhi? Of course not, they would have given money only to Delhi in that case. It\\'s truly absurd to think that the centre is restricted from handing out funds to Delhi government in case of an emergency.\\n\\n2) The money may not come out of SDMF but could come out of any number of places including but definitely not limited to the PMNRF or PM CARES fund. If you are saying that it is simply not possible for centre to hand out money to Delhi government to deal with COVID-19, that\\'s simply absurd.\\n\\n3) Delhi is going to get money sooner or later of this doesn\\'t get better. It\\'s only a matter of time. And the question would be why were they not given the money sooner, like the other states. \\n\\n4) At the end of the day what matters is that money that comes to the Delhi government, not the  route that it follows. It\\'s a job of the centre to figure out the route and they are definitely not \"\"helpless\"\" in not giving money to Delhi. If they wanted to, Delhi would have had the money by now. What nonsense.

We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India. \\xc2\\xa0This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.\\n\\nWe devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TraceTogether, MIT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Private Kit : Safe Path\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing. \\xc2\\xa0To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It\\'s possible if we try!\\n\\n## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off\\n\\nThe world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.\\n\\nHowever, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.\\n\\nRecognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.\\n\\n## Overview of the working paper\\n\\nThis [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.\\n\\nFollowing this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TraceTogether, MIT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Private Kit : Safe Path\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.\\n\\nFinally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n## We have three primary objectives from this working paper\\n\\n*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.\\n\\n*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.\\n\\n*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don\\'t have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).\\n\\n## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?\\n\\nWe will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.\\n\\nThis working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.\\n\\n## Links to our Covid related work\\n\\n1.

The budget can never ever exceed the wealth of billionaires or in fact the cumulative wealth of all citizens as well.\\n\\nBudget is only the government consumption and revenue nothing else. This is a stupid comparison.\\n\\n\\nBudget is every year. wealth is a one-time thing if you use all of it once you don\\'t have anything next year.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not saying there is huge no inequality in India. These kinds of misinformation does more harm than good. The US budget is 3.8 trillion, while their wealth of millionaires is 4-5 trillion. Just for comparison. Can provide links/working upon request. This is what happens when someone who doesn\\'t understand the difference between a flow and a stock tries to be cool. Wealth is a stock, represents a quantity at that point of time and budget is a flow, measured per year.\\n\\nAlso what a stupid title by OP. If accumulating wealth is that easy, kamake dikhao. This country will progress when people stop \"\"muh rich bad\"\" \"\"capitalism izz evil\"\". Yes, there\\'s high income inequality to address, but blaming the croporates/rich isn\\'t the solution The richest 20 billionaires in America have a combined net worth of $732 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than the bottom half of the American population, or 152 million people\\n\\nSo what\\'s the point, there are country with even less number and more money with them. More socialism will solve India\\'s problems. Sure. I can never understand nonsense like this. What do they want? A totalitarian communist state where everyone has the same money irrespective of the work they do?\\n\\nHere\\'s the deal. Human society in 2020 is structured in a way that different people perform different roles. We all influence each other and we wouldn\\'t be able to continue without that. Therefore, our interactions are monetized in a way that people who influence more people positively, make more money.\\n\\nThis is a good thing. For all the shit that idealists throw at it, free market capitalism is one of the best inventions of the 20th century. And it is absolutely fair.\\n\\nCommunism essentially says this. You are born and you immediately deserve the same thing as everyone.\\n\\nCapitalism says, you are born and you will get value, equivalent to the amount of goods and services you give to someone else.\\n\\nThe former may \"\"seem\"\" fair, but it isn\\'t.\\n\\nThe Bajaj family for instance, has almost 10 billion in wealth. They have this because the products and services they have built, influences that many individuals. It doesn\\'t make any sense to posit that they don\\'t deserve that money. They didn\\'t steal  my money. They didn\\'t hurt anyone. They sold a lot of vehicles. \\n\\nAnd this is just their net worth. A lot of that is in terms of assets like buildings and factories, which actually help other individuals by providing work opportunity.\\n\\nIf we actually want a society where there is less disparity, we need to think about giving more people more opportunities to create products and services. We should structure our taxes in such a way that a person can be born, get an education and live a healthy, free life to be able to pursue an opportunity to make their product or service available to others. That\\'s it. \\n\\nIf we go beyond that and look at the rich as some sort of evil person stealing our rightful money, we will walk down a dangerous path. We only need to look at Russia and Venezuela to see the effects of that.

We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. \\n\\n### Background\\n\\nOn 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internet shutdown framework. \\xc2\\xa0The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.\\n\\nThe government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   \\n\\n\\n### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications\\n\\nWe first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*\\n\\nNoting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   \\n\\n\\n### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs\\n\\nWe also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. \\n\\nWe recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.\\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nWhile the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir. \\xc2\\xa0Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives. \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n# Dashboards and Chatbots for All\\n\\nWhile responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health\\xe2\\x80\\x99s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.\\n\\n# Telemedicine for All\\n\\nThe difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.\\n\\nHealthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.\\n\\n# Important Documents\\n\\n1.

Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it\\'s leadership.

Now the government knows that it\\'s going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn\\'t come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.\\n\\nThe question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.\\n\\nEdit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it\\'s doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.\\n\\nEdit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries.

Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self regulation code poses to people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to receive and impart information.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nIn early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDCCC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBCCC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.\\n\\nWe have studied the IAMAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to free speech and expression.\\n\\nWe believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.\\n\\nSubsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.\\n\\n### Latest Developments\\n\\nIn an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).\\n\\nAdditionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.\\n\\nOur concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\n### What have we written?\\n\\nGiven these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.\\n\\nIFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.\\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

The money was taken out reserves kept for war time emergencies ( not sure about this). Now we are in a real health emergency. Does RBI have enough funds to balance the losses caused by this crisis. The government is trying to generate funds through many methods (PM cares, MP salary cut , world Bank loan, etc..) How long can we go on like this? Are we going to run out of cash? With no major production and export, how are we going to make money to feed the poor and daily wage workers. Are we in for collapse like Greece? Or are we going to be okay?

It\\'s possible that Nirmala Sitharaman doesnt need economics, just like she doesnt use onions. >The money was taken out reserves kept for war time emergencies\\n\\nNo. Surplus was passed on to the govt, as is always done. The surplus was much larger than normal this year so there was much media attention. But the RBI still maintains its buffer reserves. Don\\'t speculate before you read about what was actually done.\\n\\n> Are we going to run out of cash?\\n\\nI don\\'t think you understand what the RBI does. It\\'s not responsible for importing goods, its buffer exists to stabilize the rupee exchange rate. War time emergencies? Where did you get that from? You seem to have a weird understanding of economics. Most of your questions don\\'t make any sense whatsoever. Greece is a completely different thing altogether.\\n\\nThat money is surplus money the RBI had from its investment bonds and such. It became a part of the govt budget. That\\'s all there is to it. \\n\\nNo we are not going to run out of cash. That\\'s not how it works at all. We are heading into a recession, along with every other country in the world.\\n\\nMoney is not this magic resource like grains that you keep locked up in RBI and you run out. Money is just a representation of labour. As long as the country is producing goods and services, that money will have value. Because of the crisis, there are lesser goods and services being produced, but it will eventually go back to normal.\\n\\nYou can consider taking a basic economics course from a free site such as MIT open courseware to get a better understanding of basic economics. https://i.imgur.com/01UhKae.mp4\", Lolwall_here budbuk KarthikVickraman hashedram dhakkarnia\\nfacts_and_figures,1586675351.0,Policy/Economy,9,12,False,\"***Long Post Warning***\\n\\nPlease note I\\'m only looking at the big picture.

The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs.

(Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))\\n* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))\\n* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based.

I don\\'t feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.\\n\\nA couple more points I\\'d like to add:\\n\\n* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn\\'t mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.\\n* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that\\'s a story for another day.\\n\\nSumming up, I\\'d like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That\\'s the point of my post.

Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.\\n\\n4. Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.\\n\\n5. Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?\\n\\n6. Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.  \\n\\n\\nOur request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones. \\xc2\\xa0  \\n\\n\\n**Here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**\\n\\n1. The North-East District has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.\\n\\n2. Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.\\n\\n3. The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).\\n\\n4. The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.\\n\\n5. The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.\\n\\n6. In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno comment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5pa6iaun5p41.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d720d93cab9d35f9eabcfc151292e56b58c12e8\\n\\n**Why does this matter anyway?**\\n\\nThere are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.\\n\\n1. Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.\\n\\n2. Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed. \\xc2\\xa0  \\n\\n\\n**So what now?**\\n\\nIFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). The only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.   \\n\\n\\n*(This post has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal fellow at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer Sidharth)*  \\n\\n\\n**Important Documents**\\n\\n1.

This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   \\n\\n\\n**What happened?**\\n\\nLast year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone call function.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   \\n\\n\\n**What is the law related to hacking?**\\n\\nSurveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   \\n\\n\\nAdditionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  \\n\\n\\n**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**\\n\\nWe are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group \\xc2\\xa0is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   \\n\\n\\nIt was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors \\xc2\\xa0like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  \\n\\n\\n**Our recommendations**\\n\\n1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.\\n2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.\\n3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.\\n4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.\\n5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.\\n6.

And with no sign of sleep at all.\\n\\n>About me & my partners\\n\\nI\\'m a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I\\'m also a college dropout by choice so I don\\'t have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I\\'m extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.\\n\\n>Our Business - What we do\\n\\nOur business isn\\'t one of those apps or tech related business. We\\'re more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I\\'m sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.\\n\\n>How has the lockdown affected my business?\\n\\nBeing a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.\\n\\nMe along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we\\'re all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.\\n\\nThis worked smoothly with some hitches of course.\\n\\nIn January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.\\n\\nBut the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.\\n\\nOne thing I learned while doing all this is that there\\'s a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn\\'t able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It\\'s because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I\\'m not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.\\n\\nI had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn\\'t serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn\\'t change my vendor because that\\'s a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn\\'t do in my volumes which were high.\\n\\nI wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.\\n\\nI\\'m now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.\\n\\n>The finances\\n\\nI\\'m not even worried about the money, I\\'m worried about the inventory I have, I\\'m worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I\\'m refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.\\n\\n>What do I mean exactly? \\n\\nNow, I\\'m all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I\\'m going insane. I\\'m having panic attacks, I don\\'t know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don\\'t. I\\'m not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they\\'re burning.\\n\\nI\\'m also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn\\'t be a comfort for me. I\\'m not sadistic.\\n\\nI have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he\\'s a kind soul and hasn\\'t said a single word for it yet.\\n\\nBut I feel responsible and I\\'m not able to calm down.

Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we\\'re seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. \\n\\nPolitical parties don\\'t want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population \"\"control\"\". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. \\n\\nIn my view, what\\'s required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don\\'t have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-\\n\\n1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. \\n\\n2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.\\n\\n3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.\\n\\n4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don\\'t care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.\\n\\n5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. \\n\\n6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It\\'s clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one\\'s environmental impact would be to not have children.\\n\\nI want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.\\n\\nEdit: should posted this in r/unpopularopinion\",Overpopulation - how I would go about trying to fix it,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz16t8/overpopulation_how_i_would_go_about_trying_to_fix/,\" >cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy)\\n\\nI still don\\'t understand why people consider this as a successful policy in this century.\\n\\nAnyway, I would agree with your BITCH policy if that doesn\\'t involve selling one\\'s reproductive capacity and exclusive only for couples who adpot. I don\\'t think what you wrote above is gonna bring any change whatsoever. India\\'s overpopulation problem is mostly because the poor people don\\'t have much knowledge about birth control, poor families also think that the more children they have, the more are the income sources, and many people also have more children because they want a boy child, so they keep trying till it\\'s a boy. \\n\\nPoverty and illiteracy are the main reasons of this problem. Anything that the government is gonna force people to do will have more negative consequences than positive. Educating people is only gonna bring some real change imo. make it mandatory for females to go to college and get a job. that works best. see western europe. see kerala. I\\'m sorry OP but you are fundamentally misguided.\\n\\nThe replacement level total fertility rate is 2.1. As of 2017, India\\'s TFR was 2.2 with the majority of the states already below the replacement level.\\n\\nMoney is not a substitute for productive people.

Take a look at Japan to see what happens when a country has a low birthrate with low levels of immigration. 5 year relaxation for retirement age should be there for childless people.

I can share a small story that might interest some of you  \\n\\nI come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn\\'t exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there\\'s only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don\\'t get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. \\n\\nWe still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it\\'s doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.\\n\\nI still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.\\n\\nEdit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India.

Ready to answer your queries. Thanks for the video. My question is why specifically the North Indian population is affected when the milk distribution in southern India too has been done using plastic pouches.\\n\\nSecondly with regards to regulation most of the milk federation are government run or are based on cooperative bodies but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they come under ministry of health? Aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there directions from them if the PCOS cases have been so prevalent?\\n\\nThirdly norms from pollution control boards have to be tweaked to control this any idea since how long have the suggestions been submitted to find alternative forms of distribution? Hello Mr.Felix \\n\\nThanks for the wonderful video. A family member has pcos and the reasons we heard from doc was that it\\'s pretty common due to lifestyle changes in the current generation. Never in my wildest dreams did I know that a simple milk packet can lead to pcos through LDPE. \\n\\nSince I live in a city where access to milkman is limited , is it better to avoid milk . I also heard that most indians (3 out of 4) are lactose intolerant. So I feel it\\'s better to avoid milk ? The problem with unpasteurized milk is that it is a great source for various infections including Tuberculosis. Before antibiotic administration and pasteurization, about 25% of TB cases were from bovine TB. I agree the plastic is bad, but raw milk (even if boiled) still puts you at risk for getting a lot of infections. \\n\\n\\nThere is a reason most countries have mandated pasteurization of milk. \\nhttps://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/world-milk-day-raw-milk-versus-pasteurized-milk-which-one-should-you-pick-767509\\n\\nEdit: I should clarify. I am not against what you are saying Doctor, just that there is a significant danger on the other side also. Bottles are best, but extremely rare in India. Hello doctor. This is great and frightening to know about this. \\n\\nThese packet milks are not so common in Europe and America. They have bigger cans and glass bottles for same. So these diseases and abnormality of hormones are less in those countries? Hello Dr Felix, thanks for an informational video. If I search online LDPE is listed as safe for food storage and approved by US FDA?\\n\\nhttps://www.acplasticsinc.com/informationcenter/r/fda-approved-plastics-for-food-contact At least try to explain how the same compounds can cause both production of androgens in women and estrogen in men. Most cases of PCOS have 17-hydroxyprogesterone hyperresponsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation. Pls do tell us how these chemicals which u talk about cause hormonal disregulation. What is the chemical pathway? If u can\\'t, then I suggest u stop making such videos.\\n\\nAnd can u put up any case reports of increased estrogen production in young men of normal weight? It better not be a case of receptor dysfunction since that has nothing to do with what ur claiming. This \\'gender bender\\' which u talk about (what a ridiculous term), seems to be an imaginary condition. \\n\\nYet another half-baked conspiracy video. I encourage pple here to ignore this stupid video which has no proof of anything. Good day This was very useful Dr. Bast. Thank you for doing it. Hello Dr Felix, \\n\\nFirst of all, great video. I just have one question. \\n\\nWe don\\'t exactly have access to milk man in our area, so only choice for us is to buy packed milk and we cannot avoid milk also as we have very young kids in our house. So my question is, how much time does it take for the plastic to release those harmful chemicals in milk? Is it immediately? Or it takes few hours or something? (Sorry if it doesn\\'t make any sense to you, but I think you will get the context)\\n\\nReason I am asking this is to know how we can minimize the risk if we cannot avoid this. And yes we do empty the milk in utensils immediately after bringing the milk home and also heat it before refrigerating it. What about the milk in Tetra packs?

A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously \\xe2\\x80\\x93 something best embodied by a Brahmin.\\n\\nThe percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.\\n\\nThe burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.\\n\\nBroadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.\\n\\nHow fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.\",Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,\" People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions \\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzuKz1fuQg\\n\\nHowever, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their \\xe2\\x80\\x98non-Indianess\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for in their logic such people could only be \\xe2\\x80\\x98Chinese\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins.

There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It\\'s not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It\\'s all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have electricity until a few years ago\\n\\nOutside our village was a basti of the Chamars\\n\\nThey certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face.

I hope someday we can see through this bs it\\'s a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words \"\"Indian\"\" and \"\"caste\"\" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the \"\"pujari\"\" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. \\n\\nIt is only a few \"\"elitist\"\" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites).

While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I\\'ve seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)\\n\\nGoing  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn\\'t  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\\\\_got\\\\_my\\\\_hand\\\\_on\\\\_some\\\\_real\\\\_naan\\\\_and\\\\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)\\n\\nThe   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I\\'m  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I\\'m feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more \"\"breadier\"\"  crumb   to naan, while I\\'m actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti\\'s crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn\\'t sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don\\'t have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn\\'t stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don\\'t survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,\\n\\nSo   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday\\'s dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n(Asked this in in r/IndianFood but couldn\\'t x-post, so asking here.\",Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,\" Most of them don\\'t. The bubbly part is because of the dough being treated to sudden high temperature inside the tandoor. The water inside quickly turns to vapours thus forming those bubbles Nope,  They dont use yeast.  Bubbles are due to air and watervapour  trapped in the  flattened dough  when cooking . \\n\\n\\nIn many cases they  they dont leave dough enough time for yeast to start fermenting. \\n\\nSo its not due to yeast Khameeri roti is the one made with yeast, I think.

From the indus Valley time\\'s  lothal port to trading with Africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.\\n\\nIn order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won\\'t spoil easily. This is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part\",Theory : gujrati food has so many dry snacks because of their long distance travelling since ancient times,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f5aarr/theory_gujrati_food_has_so_many_dry_snacks/,\" But, by that logic shouldn\\'t odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far East. Now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. It\\'s based on my mother and my grandmother\\'s account of her childhood.\\n\\nBasically, Gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. Pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. Back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. Groundnut was another crop. So you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. Oil used is also the same while much of North India used sarson.. (which is non existent in Gujarat, btw). White rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. Earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (My mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) Most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in South Gujarat). In Saurashtra, it would be bajra. Again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (May be post 70s). \\n\\nMy grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. For most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) Sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. No green veggies for summer. So you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that\\'s what was available. \\n\\nActually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and Maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. The super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (I remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won\\'t get anything...it\\'s consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  Also, they are not limited to Gujarat only. Even South has its variant of \"\"murukku\"\". The Gujarati or rather Central Indian snacks became more famous recently because of Haldiram maybe? Even the \"\"murmura\"\" snacks are common in much of India. \\n\\nBut yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. Though that has to do with our \"\"save money for 1 meal\"\" tendency plus \"\"won\\'t find vegetarian food\"\" problem. Don\\'t think it has much to do with the seafarers. They probably had an abundance of macchi from the Arabian sea on their way to Africa. This is the state of affairs. The OP posted a theory based on Geopolitics about Food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the OP or Gujaratis. \\n\\nAbout the theory, quite plausible. It is often the case that even today Gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. This is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as Farsan (not just Gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. \\nBut that\\'s just my perspective, I am sure you will find some research about it.\\n\\nIf interested, by far the best Travel food I have found is HardTack or Ship Biscuit. It lasts years, museums have HardTack from the 1700s which is still edible. Plausible. I remember hearing something similar on Raja Rasoi show on Netflix. Don\\'t know man. There are so many preservatives like salt, which would have been abundant in Gujarat. While it is highly plausible that dry foods would be the norm for sea faring traders, we don\\'t see the same in the southern foods, who traded with Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and the eastern coast, who traded with the Chinese. It\\'s possible, but not conclusive. One I heard about Rajasthan is that their food is spicy because it make people to drink more water than usual, given the extreme hot weather Gujjus and their Besan. It\\'s the worst thing for nutrition values. No wonder the state has highest number of cases of under and malnutrition as compared to India. WHO always worries about that state\\'s health and nutrition since decades. But why unhealthy snacks? Do they have sweet snacks because excessive travelling led them to make constant sources of energy?\\n\\n\\nman,people will boast about breathing air theses days. Isn\\'t this like common knowledge?

What you said about Indians being vegetarian is correct. We make use of milk products. So veganism is rare in India You are right. In India, vegetarians predominantly means no meat, no egg, but can consume milk. Indian vegetarians are a complex bunch. \\n\\nThere are pure vegetarians who do not eat meat and eggs. \\n\\nThere are people who consider Onion and garlic as non-veg and don\\'t eat them too. \\n\\nThen there are people who don\\'t eat non-veg on particular days of the week or year. \\n\\nThere are vegetarians who eat eggs, but this is not a religoius choice but a personal one. \\n\\nVeganism is a western concept and almost everyone has a dairy-based diet. \\n\\nHaving said that, not only desserts, India is a heaven when it comes to vegetarian food. Most of the ingredients are again dairy based.\\n\\nAlso almost all cakes sold here are eggless. Most indian vegetarians are lacto-vegetarians. The rest are ovo-lacto-vegetarians (some of them call themselves eggitarians in jest).\\n\\nIf there is egg or any non-vegetarian food in any pre packaged item, then it has a red sticker on it (a green solid circle within a square boundary). Otherwise for lacto-vegetarian food the sticker is green. \\n\\nCakes usually contain egg. But eggless cakes are also available. \\n\\nIndian sweets use dairy products, especially KHOYA (condensed milk I believe). \\n\\nWhere I live - Delhi NCR - usually the western stuff like cakes and pastries have eggs in them by default. You would have to specifically ask for an \"\"eggless cake\"\" to get an eggless cake. yes crazy about milk, that\\'s basically the origin of \"\"cow worshipping\"\" We eat everything except meat and eggs. >But at least here in Europe, eggs are everywhere, especially in cakes and cookies and everything sweet.
