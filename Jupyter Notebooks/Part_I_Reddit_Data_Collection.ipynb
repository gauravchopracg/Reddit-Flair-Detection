              "   'Background – Pre 2007\\n\\nBefore anything, Nowhera Shaikh was a daughter of a vegetable vendor.  As she grew up, she started teaching small children how to read the Quran in various madrassas in a Tirupur locality.  Later on, she started collecting money from the local people in her area promising them monthly payments at such an interest rate that would double the amount of the capital investment in a year’s time.  All of this was done without an office in a small remote town near Tirupur.  People trusted her as she was also involved in teaching kids how to read the Quran.  As the investments grew, the need to sustain it brought in more people to join in to become Core Members of Nowhera Shaikh’s so-called business, and so the business began to expand.  Availability of money, gave rise to the idea of gold trading, Ghana.  During those times, buying gold dust from Ghana, illegally exporting it to other countries, selling it for a margin, converting the profit into Gold Bars, and bringing it back to India was a lucrative trade even though illegal.  Hawala was used for money transactions in and out of India.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nGhana Gold Business Facts\\n\\nThis was the initial business propagated, which helped Nowhera Shaikh and her close aids establish a name for herself and her aids.  The story Nowhera Shaikh and her aids put out was that Nowhera Shaikh owns a company named Heera Gold, and Heera Gold had a contract with Ghana government which helped them get gold in a cheaper rate from Ghana, i.e., 4.5% discount on the daily rate of gold in Ghana.  They would then sell the gold they purchased on a 1.5% discount from the day’s rate to renowned companies established in the Gulf, such as D-Damas and other credible gold refining companies.  They also used to mention that D-Damas specifically had a capacity to buy and process 500 kg of gold dust on a daily basis, and this made the business seem huge.  Nobody questioned as to why couldn’t a company such as D-Damas get into a similar contract with Ghana Government.  Nowhera Shaikh’s ability to mesmerize people played an important role in achieving success in inducing people to invest on her trade.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nInitial Offices of Heera Group &amp; Companies\\n\\nHuge money started pouring in in the name of Ghana Gold Business, and the first of offices in the name of Heera Gold were opened in Mira Road, Thane, in the year 2007. One Mr. Farid was the incharge of this office. In the year 2008, Salim Ansari opened an office in Bhindi Bazar. Dr. Rizwan Shaikh used to work in that office. Dr. Rizwan Shaikh’s wife became an ME. In the year 2016 to 2017, Dr. Rizwan Shaikh’s son became an ME. Nazneen of Jeddah is a Pakistani Citizen, who also has been with Heera Group since the beginning.',\n",

              "   \"There's been a global shortage of human and equine rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) since 2001 as major manufacturers stopped manufacturing it, and the rest are failing to meet demand. Not sure if it's changed, but getting it in India is fairly rare - restricted to a few states only (like Telangana apparently).\\n\\nWhy does this matter? If you've been bit - or even been licked on an open wound or the face - by a rabid animal (usually dogs, but also bats and others) then you are at risk of catching rabies. The severity of the exposure determines what must be done next, as well as whether you've been vaccinated before:\\n\\nA severe exposure requires both a vaccine and a RIG dose near the area affected. The shortage means that you might have to go round the country to search for a shot, and these can cost up to 20-30,000 (in addition to the vaccine)! It becomes a race against the clock (even though rabies is slow moving). This happened in the past with someone who was bitten and scratched by a monkey (according to a news report), and they described the experience of finding treatment worse than being bitten!\\n\\nOTOH if you are already vaccinated, you don't need the RIG, just the vaccines are enough. This is significantly cheaper - each vaccine is about 350-500 and is required 4-5 times for a total of ~2500, one-tenth of just the RIG cost, and is available in almost every hospital in the country.\\n\\nAnd no, it hasn't been the 21-shot vaccine for quite a while now. This is for about 5 times and is not much more painful than any other vaccine given in the arm. The peace of mind alone is worth it, if nothing else.\\n\\nThe only downside is that all the shots aren't given at once - you have to keep coming back each time and not many people would have the time for that and requires planning (although missing the deadlines by a day or two is far better than not taking it at all)\",\n",

Even some golden movies like DDLJ were uninteresting to me/never seen it so I thought maybe I like hollywood or other countries' movies because of the big budget, foreign feel with new things, great VFX, use of English and what not but honestly those things were secondary or external factors. It was mostly about great acting, good cinematography, the way they create private real life moments in front of camera, the way they live in those moments.\\n\\nIt's been nearly half century for the beginning of indian movies and we have nothing but few movies which were amazing attempt to sell new ideas making it worth a while eg. Swades,Dil Chahta hai and few others . Real was always rare in our movies and there was hardly any effort to move ahead of keeping love as focus or end goal. \\n\\n\\rAverage movies also create average critics and also average or below average actors who make their whole career based on it being loved by average fans following. Honestly instead of porn ban we should had shitty movie ban which sells the idea of objectifying woman and normalize forcing love on some random person till they accepts it and yes these affects people as you can already see how people think beloved celeb personality is same as it is in their movies. All and all I  want to say it, 2018 was amazing leaving me hope for bollywood but nepotism still exists, my sister told me that the role of female lead in Simba(another average movie) was signed by a acting reality show winner but then was replaced by Saif Ali Khan's daughter.\\n\\n\\rThere are some amazing underrated critics like Film Companion(Sucharita), Cinema Beyond Entertainment, Mensutra(maybe)  and with the end of nepotism, I wonder how much bollywood will improve with new quality actors and their creations.  \\n    \\n\\n\\n  \\n\",\n",

Things were moving very quickly for us and in the third or fourth week, she tells me our relationship will not last forever. She says her parents are extremely traditional and for her to bring someone home who is not Gujarati Indian would be devastating. I've learned more about the culture from her over the last couple months and I understand where she's coming from. We want to continue to see each other until we graduate and just create some nice memories. My question to you guys - what would you do? Would you continue or cut it off now? My heart aches at the thought of it ending, so should I just end it now? Is there any chance for us beyond our time at school? Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)   \",\n",

              "   \"So there's this girl in my office who I like. We hang out quite often to toke. We are also neighbors. I have been thinking of asking her out, but still growing a pair of balls to do that. Before people go on a rant about 'Don't shit where you eat' or 'don't date someone at work' - Certain circumstances in my workplace are supportive of this and I have already made up my mind. My question is slightly different.\\n\\nSo this girl - is basically an orphan. Her mom passed away, and she is estranged from her father (as he didn't want to pay for her education in an expensive university). She owes her university lakhs of rupees, but my employer has been benevolent and after her assessment internship she was given a job despite not having a degree.\\n\\nSo she was raised in Calcutta, but has most of her friends in Delhi (where she studied). She absolutely and utterly HATES Mumbai. She feels like a hostage to the city and she is forced to be here just for the sake of her job. She is seeking an internal transfer to Delhi and has been told that it will be approved, but only in 2020.\\n\\nShe has now become a stoner recluse, who almost had a brush with alcoholism. She just stays inside her apartment smoking one joint after another and mindlessly streaming Netflix, while being depressed about her state.  She barely steps out of home on weekends and stays long hours in the office cause she doesn't have friends in Mumbai and cause she doesn't like returning to her home alone. \\n\\nIt seems that this is the first time she has been put in such a situation as she was generally coddled by her mom a lot and was brought up in a relatively protective environment. \\n\\nI am not able to figure her out. I have been spending time with her and figure her out, but somehow our connection seems 'shallow' and restricted to discussing work. Somewhere, it seems either I am not prying deep enough, or she is not being forthcoming.\\n\\nI want to pull her out of this weird depression. I want to show her that this city is more than just a 'sustenance machine for people in the nadir of their existence'. The most fucked up thing she said is that 'I feel safer in a club in Delhi than in Bombay since I know that if I get into trouble in Delhi, my friends will come to help me'\\n\\nCan you please give me tips on how to do this? She is interested in board games, animals and anything related to despicable me. (Her desk is littered with minions of all kinds)\\n\\nTL;DR: Girl I have a crush on hates Mumbai and wants to leave it ASAP. She is kinda depressed and spends her weekends smoking hash and binge watching Netlfix in her flat.  I want to show her that it's not such a bad place. Where do I start?\",\n",

She had a very shitty life after our breakup and she has now given up on her life completely. Almost Engaged to another guy now but says she still have feelings for me and would like to be in touch\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am in a really difficult situation right now and would need some perspective from a third person. I used to date a girl long back and we broke up in late 2017. I was in strict No contact mode and never even looked at her pictures/Facebook etc. I assumed that she would be happy as she initiated the break up and it was very messy for me as I did not see that coming.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow all of a sudden she texted me to wish for New Years and I initially ignored it. She then called me and I picked up. From the first word itself I knew that she still have the same feelings for me and it was like we never broke up. We talked for hours and she then told me about her life in the past year. Her closest family member passed away during that year and there were a lot of health issues in her family.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHer social life also took a hit as she is now left with only one friend in her group. They used to be like 5 people in her closest friend circle and all of them drifted apart. After that death in her family, her parents emotionally manipulated her to agree for a marriage that she is not really into. I know what kind of life she used to picture for her and it is definitely not what she is signing up for with that arranged marriage. When I asked her about this, she says she is not interested anymore with what happens in her life and she doesn’t care now . That part worries me a lot. She says she still have the same feelings for me and still would have the same even after her marriage. But she was feeling very guilty all this time to contact me as she broke it off earlier and hurted me a lot.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFrom my end, I used to think that it would made me happy if she suffers in her life because how she broke up with me. But now I feel very bad that I was not there for her when she needed me the most. I know that it was not my fault and she could’ve texted me earlier but i still feel bad about it and I don’t know why. I don’t even like how she is throwing her life away like this now. I really don’t know what to do. \\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen she called me she told me that she is going to resign her job before going to her hometown for the marriage. She also said even though it is wrong to do so, she wanted to be like my long distance gf now Atleast until she goes back to her hometown. She is basically engaged now to another guy. But she wanted to talk to me like earlier days and be together till she goes back to her hometown. She also did not tell that other guy about me and she is not planning to do so in the future as she intends to keep in touch with me ( just basic convos, nothing romantic ) after marriage. I convinced her against the idea of being together till she goes back but she insists on keeping touch after marriage. I want to help her but I really don’t know what to do. I do still have feelings for her but she says things are out of hand now. I cannot ask her to tell her parents upfront that she cannot marry that guy as I am not  100% sure that my parents would accept her. At this stage it is very risky for her to get out of that marriage.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am not able to think straight at all about this. Any perspective/advice would help me a lot. My gut says that I should never contact her again and we both still have very strong feelings for each other and I am not able to see her throw her life away like this. I thought it would make me happy but this pains a lot.',\n",

I googled, found out that these 2 companies have started with some new shit to have a regular monthly income with plans that are called \"unlimited internet pack\" and if you don\\'t recharge you guessed it right your number will be blocked. How nice...does this come under bullying?\\nI wanted to get to the core of this, so visited the official store to get more info. They said they changed some rules. So i asked why i wasn\\'t being informed about them. You cannot bombard me with messages that your outgoing will be stopped for no reason and also when i already have a huge balance. So i asked who exactly changed this rule...you , TRAI , who? They claim that TRAI changed it. So i asked to show me the appropriate policy to which they said you can find that on TRAI website. They said to officially mail them to get appropriate link.\\nI asked for my options to which they said u have to do monthly recharge of Rs. 35(Rs. 26TT) to keep your sim card active. I was like wtf is this? Why do i have pay a monthly on a prepaid sim? I went in deeper and they said this is the minimum recharge you have to do no matter what. And surprisingly the validity of this recharge is *28 Days*. This mean pay 13 times in a duration of 12 months. Now this is turning to be annoying.\\nI hardly use my phone to make any calls. When I\\'m home i use Wi-Fi to make calls and same when I\\'m out. I hardly use normal calling while travelling. I don\\'t feel the need to put any data pack. I recharge only when its necessary and in emergencies. This is exactly why i took a prepaid sim. Forcing a monthly (which is not at all monthly) recharge defeats the purpose of getting a prepaid sim in the 1st place.\\nShould we be bullied into this and not speak against it? If this rule is really forced by TRAI then why aren\\'t other operators also doing the same?\\nWhat are my options here? Should i port out to other operator? I don\\'t want Jio at all. I just need a sim to use in emergency at affordable rate. Which 1 do you think will be the best for me[Mumbai region] ?\\nAlso how do i fight against this stupid rule?

              "   'Muhammed Mahmood Alam is a  celebrated war hero in Pakistan for his fete in the 1965 Indo-Pak war, I  find the claim that he shot down 5 IAF jets in less than a minute  rather dubious. I will justify:\\n\\nAlam and  his wingman, Flt.Off. Akhtar, took off shortly after the first Indian  attack against Sargodha on the morning of the 7 September 1965, and  shortly after the clash between the Mystére flown by Sqn.Ldr. Devayya  and two Starfighters, in which both the Indian, and one of the Pakistani  fighers were shot down.\\n\\nThis is already a  first discrepancy in Pakistani claims, as Fricker (and the \"whole  World\", if you wish) said that Sqn.Ldr. Devayya was the first victim of  Sqn.Ldr. M.M. Alam. H. He was in fact shot down by Flt. Lt. Amjad Hussain trying to attack him where both planes collided and Hussain was able to eject last minute and survived. Devayya died during the collision. \\n\\nRegarding Alam\\'s claims:   \\n1.)  He first claimed to have intercepted a formation of six Hunters and  fired one Sidewinder against one of them. The missile hit the ground,  and then, in Alam\\'s own words: \"The next thing I remember was that I was  overshooting one of the Hunters and when I looked behind, the cockpit  canopy was missing and there was no pilot in the aircraft. He had  obviously pulled up and ejected and then I saw him coming down by  parachute.\" Very nice, but this all happened at some 500 knots and  flight level of some 45feets/15 meters: would be interessting to learn  how Alam managed to see so many details under such circumstances?\\n\\nAlmost  needles to say: Alam\\'s victim, Sqn.Ldr. Onkar Nath Kacker, CO 27 Sqn  IAF, flew back for over 150 kilometers as his engine stopped due to a  booster pump failure. It is possible that his Hunter was damaged by the  proxy-fusing Sidewinder, but Kacker certainly didn\\'t ejected close to  Sargodha and was not killed. So, Alam\\'s claim is wrong: he couldn\\'t see a  Hunter with empty cockpit.\\n\\n2.) Immediately  afterwards, Alam lost the sight of these six Hunters, but he had plenty  of fuel and started a pursuit. After some 60 miles, coming over the  Chenab River, Akhtar called out five Hunters in - Alam\\'s words:  \"...absolutely immaculate battle formation...\" He turned behind Hunters  and now comes the best part of the story:\\n\\n\"We  were all turning very tightly - in excess of 5G or just about on the  limits of the Sabre\\'s very accurate A-4 radar ranging gunsight...And I  think before we had completed more than about 270 degrees of the turn,  at around 12 degrees per second, all four Hunters had been shot down. In  each case, I got the pipper of my sight around the canopy of the Hunter  for virtually a full deflection shot...\"\\n\\nWell,  Alam explained later about him developing a technique of firing very  short bursts, and that he flew Hunters previously himself (in England).  However, the fact is, that Pakistanis later found only two supposed  victims of Alam.\\n\\nAnd not only this, then now  it will get really bad for the PAF\\'s credibility. Initially, the PAF  had released the names of the five pilots shot down by Sqn. Ldr. M.M.  Alam; as Sqn.Ldr. O.N. Kacker, Sqn.Ldr. A.B. Devayya, Sqn.Ldr. S.B.  Bhagwat, Flt.Lt. U.B. Guha and Flg.Off. J.S. Brar. Some later Pak sources claim Flt.Lt.  T.K. Chaudary as one of Alam\\'s victims, but I don\\'t know where did they  got that name from. By the way, Chaudary/Chaudry is a very usual name  in India and in Pakistan.\\n\\nFurthermore, none  of Indian records (not claims) show that these names do coincide with  their organisation of the attack against Sargodha. Namely: all these  pilots DIDN\\'T flew aircraft which were part of only ONE or TWO attacks  against Sargodha, flown early in the morning and intercepted by Alam,  but SIX! And not only this: all these six Indian attacks against  Sargodha happened between 06:00 in the morning and 15:00 in the  afternoon! So, Alam could hit four Hunters in less than one minute, but  those that fell to the ground did so in more than nine hours! And that  is - sorry SOC - impossible.\\n\\nFor example:  Devayya was from Strike No.1 (undertaken early in the morning), Kacker  from 3rd Indian strike and Guha from 6th Indian strike (undertaken in  the afternoon). Furthermore, these names do not correspond with the  names from the 4th Indian strike, for which the PAF states that Alam  shot down the four Hunters! The result: Alam most probably only got two  Indian Hunters during the whole day: Fg. Off. Brar and Sqn. Ldr.  Bhagwat. Both were killed as their planes crashed. The rest came away,  that of Sqn.Ldr. O.N. Kacker crashed due to technical problems and all  of the other of Alam\\'s \"victims\" are still very much alive today.\\n\\nWell,  if someone asks me, both sides have many materials from that war,  especially gun-kills of every single kill. If there are so many kills  scored by Sqn.Ldr. Alam, and other Pakistani pilots, then the PAF should  publish them, but it didn\\'t. OK, gun-camera pics show some things, but  certainly not all, like date, place etc. So, if so many Hunters crashed  inside of Pakistan after they were shot down by Alam, then Pakistanis  must be in possession of their wreckage. And that is not the case,  because otherwisen 06:00 and 15:00h in the Sargodha area as victims of  Sqn.Ldr. Alam, which supposedly shot them all down in less than  half-an-hour.\\n\\nAs one can see, Indians have  delivered their proofs, and showed that this small amount of Pakistani  evidence for \"four Hunters in less than one minute\" shot down by  Sqn.Ldr. M.M. Alam is worth nothing. I do not understand what should be  wrong with all of that, or why not to belive it? After all, everybody in  the West use to belive the side which is able to deliver more and  better proofs for its case.\\n\\nLastly, Air Commodor S.Sajjad Haider of the Pakistani Air Force said, \"*It  is tactically and mathematically very difficult to resurrect the  incident in which all five Hunters in a hard turn were claimed to have  been shot down in a 270-degree turn in 23 seconds\"* .\\n\\nPAF  Cdre S.Sajad Haider have demolished Alam\\'s claim saying, “Logically,  since the five were claimed to have been shot down in 23 seconds, then  they should all have crashed in close proximity. The conjecture that all  the rest could have crashed after 8-9 minutes of flying is superfluous  and unworthy of the official PAF history.” The PAF’s 1988 history is  surprisingly silent about the names. In fact, the PAF 1988 history does  not even list the names of the five IAF pilots.”\\n\\nThis  is not to say the Pakistanis were chumps. On the contrary, they were  excellent flyers and gunners. However, PAF pilots seemed to have  underestimated Indian resolve, and also believed their President Ayub  Khan’s claim that one Pakistani was equal to three Indians.\\n\\nReligious  fanaticism was also seen rearing its ugly head in the PAF, with many  pilots believing they were under divine protection. Alam, for instance,  became an Islamic fundamentalist and berated his fellow officers and  seniors who consumed alcohol. Not surprisingly, he was sidelined on the  amusing allegation that he could not read or write. Post retirement, he  lives like a mullah, a virtual recluse. Had he been a real war hero, he  would not be treated in so humiliating a manner.\\n\\nI appreciate him for 2 confirmed hunter kills during the whole day, which is very commendable but this false claim led me having no respect for him.\\n\\nBritish  writer John Fricker was commissioned by the PAF to write a book, in  which Fricker eulogised the Pakistanis. His ‘Battle for Pakistan – The  Air War of 1965’ made it to the stores only in 1979 because he couldn’t  find a publisher. But because he couldn’t narrate his tales soon enough,  Fricker wrote an article titled “30 Seconds Over Sargodha” which was  published in ‘Aeroplane’ magazine.\\n\\nFricker’s  article popularised Alam’s claim in the West, where they gleefully  accepted such fiction as truth. There was a huge sense of satisfaction  in the West at India’s apparent failure.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;',\n",

              "   'This happened in 2009 (hurray 10 years). There was this bully or an let’s say an asshole who keeps picking people for silly fights. He insults kids, judge them based in looks, slaps softly (not by palms but with two fingers on cheeks just to move the face). Naturally I was his victim of insults though 99.9% it was a school time fun. \\n\\nHe doesn’t go to gym but his arms are muscular from push ups and pull up. It’s 2009 as I mentioned before. Barely a year after Ghajini released. A lot of teenagers got the Ghajini fever and began working out, asking fellow boys to touch their abs. Showing off the veins in forearms. I knew I had no chance against him.\\n\\nBut One day, for reasons which I don’t remember now - he crossed the limits. I got angry and we had a fight which started from the boys corner and eventually ended infront of everyone. It wasn’t serious fights but just pushed and pulls however I - surprisingly - had the strength to push him and resist his push. The fight was so intense that I wasn’t aware the whole class was seeing because I really had to vent out my anger. This happened between the period breaks and then our maths teacher just entered when she saw me and him fighting. The fight continued even after she entered because we didn’t see her. It was after turning my back that I saw her staring at us. Upon asking why we fought I said helplessly that he was crossing limits but this guy began crying and acting like the victim. I was really surprised by \\n\\n1. How he managed to turn tables and be the victim. I’m was a loser in class and it’s common sense that I won’t pick people for fights. Everybody (atleast in the boy section) knows who started the fight.\\n\\n2. That he cried. This was the first time people saw him crying. He’s really a tough and cocky dude and this contradicted the inner him. \\n\\nI was in 10th grade when this happened. Two years later in 12th I overheard someone talking about this fight. even after this he kept picking fights and one day it was against a big dude. He was my friend but oh boy I wouldn’t want him to be my enemy. He’s a softy but this bully picked on him that he got angry. He got trashed badly. No way he could stand against this guy. Naturally people understood that he’s just a shoe off and he isn’t to be taken seriously. \\n\\nAfter the fight I lost all the fear I had in him. He’s not tough but he acts like one. Teacher didn’t blame him because he studies (esp maths and that’s where I’m the weakest).\\n\\n\\nNarendra Modi reminded me of him. He picks people and insults (Nehru, Indira Gandhi’s emergency, Italian Bar dancer, million dollar girlfriend) yet he don’t have the balls to face criticism or insults. Not only he don’t have the balls but he complains that he is being insulted (mother) or he is being targeted for Assasination by naxalites. He can’t face honest interviews. He is a coward under the disguise of a tough leader. He either wants Respect when he wins or sympathy when he’s losing against opponents. He’s a bully who’s a softy inside. Seeing him now reminded me of him. He is that bully who acts strong as tough but complains when he gets the karma of his behavior. \\n\\nI hope this post isn’t against the rules and I hope I got the flair right since it’s majorly a personal incident which I relate to politics.',\n",

Why not directly jump to writing c programs.\\n\\n**Well, this article on Introduction to C Programming is very important to learn. I strongly recommend reading this before jumping to programming. Because it will help you to understand several important processes. For instance, memory allocation, the working process of different hardware. And all these things will help you in cracking interview easily or to become a pro developer.**\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n&gt;***Don’t Skip :*** *Before writing serious programs in C, it would be interesting to know what really is C (****introduction to C Programming****), how it came into existence and why it is called as mother of programming language. Hey smarty, We will go from very basic to advance so that your friends can also follow this article easily.*\\n\\n### What is a Computer?\\n\\n**A computer is an electronic gadget that takes input from the user, process that input and gives output.** Laptops, Desktop computers, mobile phone, Digital watch, Digital camera, etc are also computers as they work on given input however their capabilities differ. You might be asking this is too basic however there is connectivity read below.\\n\\n### Does zero or one exist inside a computer?\\n\\n**Well, there is no physical significance of 0 and 1 inside the computer.** These are just representation of two states of voltage in digital circuits, the high voltage is represented with 1 and low voltage with 0.\\n\\n### Why understand 0 and 1 fundamentals?\\n\\nComputers understand only binary language which is represented in the form of 0 and 1. Computers are just a machine that can work on our instruction. But, we can’t say “Computer! Please print my name on screen”. Yeah, if we can!\\n\\nA computer can’t work in the above situation as it doesn’t understand our language. Just assume computers as aliens which understand only the language of 0 and 1.\\n\\n&gt;***Program is a set of instructions to perform a specific task. Running a program instruction is called process.***\\n\\n### Why Learn C Language?\\n\\nInstead of being one of the oldest programming languages, C is not dead yet. In these days also C language is very popular because of its **reliability, simplicity, easy to use** features.\\n\\nThere are many opinions that are often heard today is – “C has been superseded by other programming languages like C++, C#, and Java”.

(The reason to move being they overcharged for food  and the food quality was subpar)\\n\\nAll  went well. I took money out from my fathers atm card (which he gave me  since i did not have an account) and paid for the advance/caution money +  rent.\\n\\nNow here is where the fuck up  begins. I only withdrew the amount of money that i needed; nothing  extra. (I figured i would withdraw from January 1 and plan my big  expenses for the month as i was planning to reducing my spending this  month)\\n\\nHowever on December 31 all magnetic strip atm cards were blocked. Leaving me with no way to access the money.\\n\\nMy  father is out of station. He will be back in about a month and i have  ran out of cash (that i need to buy food. Since the new hostel does not  include it) and here i am stuck. At the moment i am surviving on a kg  pack of oats that i got in the previous month. I don't think it will  last me a month (especially since i am eating it for every meal)\\n\\nI got my paytm up and running but i can't add any money since the debit/atm card is blocked.\\n\\nTLDR - Was an idiot. Debit card is blocked, can't issue a new one immediately. Need another way to access the money.\\n\\nAsk any additional details that i forgot to mention which might help.\",\n",

My parents are supportive of me for doing so, so that wasnt a problem there. \\n\\nI have done my research on what pure mathematics consists of (like the topics such as group theory, number theory, etc) and it is definitely something im very interested in. The only problem that i think i have that anyone around me who wants to do the same(very few btw) have been studying for mathematical olympiards and whatnot since 8th grade. Since i realised this in 12th I have had no time to study for rmo or look into any of it thoroughly, but it does seem challenging. Im not particularly extremely smart, but I know that I'm well above average. So im very confused as to the fact that if i choose to pursue this will i fall behind because I have no prior knowledge of any advanced topics. Any advice?\",\n",

The notice period exists so the employer can arrange for a replacement to continue doing your job and projects aren\\'t adversely affected. In cases of site projects, having less than the required number of employees at a site can incur penalties from the project owner. But employees think of this as \"Company holding me against my will\".\\n\\nPeople put in resignations and just walk out leaving the company short. This is why the trend of paying a months salary at the end of the next month exists in India.\\n\\nEven worse are the people who do not resign at all and straight up disappear from their job without any intimation or those who do not return at all from their vacations. These are extremely shitty things to do and also why makes companies implement policies such as no leave allotment in the first year of employment. \\n\\nBigger companies are able to handle these issues but these are body blows to small and medium scale companies. It\\'s not a question of education since the examples I did provide are of engineers, it\\'s a question of ethics.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen there are issues are people using company time and resources to work on independent projects for side cash, even being dumb enough to use company email for said activities. I hope I don\\'t need to explain why this is a problem and I wouldn\\'t believe it was a problem if I hadn\\'t seen it myself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis and a lot more unethical shit is far too common in India and instead of fostering a good work environment, results in hostility between the employee and an employer and the employer taking action to protect themselves from this harm results in worse conditions for all employees.

              "   'I know NRIs tend to get a lot of hate on this sub, but I wanted to just throw my feelings out there. \\n\\nI was born in Delhi but I only lived there the first three years of my life. I have grown up in the United States and am currently in college, but I still maintained a close connection with my Indian relatives and heritage my entire life. \\n\\nI travelled to India two years ago for my cousin\\'s wedding and at the time, still being an easily impressionable kid, I was in awe of the apparent glitz and glamour and all of the money and festivities involved. Indian life, or at least what I had seen of it during that trip, looked so incredible to me and I began to romanticize it. \\n\\nTwo years later, I have returned to India on a new trip. It has now been a week for me here in Delhi, and my experience so far has entirely destroyed all the positive thoughts I had from last time. \\n\\nI truly hope that not all of India is like my family - which I have now seen to be entirely racist, sexist, and homophobic - and therefore there is still some hope, but sadly I am sure that the mentality that resides within my family resonates throughout the majority of North India. \\n\\nIn order to understand how the culture is here, I wanted to ask my relatives a variety of taboo questions in order to bring out their most reserved thoughts, and I did so. One of the questions I asked was \"what would you do if your child turned out to be gay?\". Every single relative of mine responded with absolutely horrible reactions, one of them even suggesting killing the child. Almost all of them said they would throw the child out of the house, and one said \"society is more important than family\" \\n\\nBeyond that, every single one of my relatives is blatantly racist towards black people. Every single one of them has said how ugly and criminal minded black people are, and that I should not keep black friends. It was so unfortunate to hear things like this because I actually had a very close African American friend who wanted to come to Delhi with me this time but I had to tell him no because I knew how terrible the mentality of the people here would be towards him. \\n\\nNo one in my family has any kind of idea of gender equality. Every single one of them said \"no absolutely not\" when I asked if women should be able to do almost all the things men can do socially. \\n\\nI honestly don\\'t even consider myself a very liberal person in American society, but after hearing the horrible things I\\'ve heard from my relatives this trip, I have lost almost all faith in North Indian culture and optimism for the future. Everyone here is so stuck up in their racist/sexist beliefs and their romanticism of the caste system. They have no knowledge of outside culture nor do they want to develop it. Hell, they aren\\'t even knowledgable of their OWN culture. Every person I asked admitted they aren\\'t devout Hindus, and yet they have temples in their homes and do fasts just as formalities. I truly feel like I have more knowledge of Hindu principles and the history of the case system than my relatives, and they unlike me have lived here their entire lives.\\n\\nThe worst reality though, is the mentality I have seen from numerous people here that \"jaise hai woh vaise hi rahega bhai. Ye India hai\"\\n\\nVery few people here seem willing to spread their horizons and become more openminded. I don\\'t see this prevalent lack of tolerance changing at all in the coming years outside of the larger urban areas and the extremely liberal youth. This resonates into many other aspects of society too - pollution for example. It is so difficult to even find a dustbin here. Everyone just throws stuff anywhere and laughs if I ask if there\\'s a proper trash disposal. No matter how much  India\\'s economy thrives in the coming years, I still think it will remain a very backward culture that is far far far removed from what it was supposed to be. ',\n",

Everytime I use Billdesk and BHIM/UPI option for the same. \\nPayment is successful and transaction complete. \\n\\nI start receiving calls and emails from Tata regarding non payment. They create a ticket promising to resolve it. They ask for my bank statement, on providing that they ask for me to talk my bank and ask them for billdesk transaction ID. I provide them with the same. \\n\\nSuddenly the ticket is closed and the whole process starts again. Since everytime a new person gets assigned this ticket, I am highly surprised at how incompetent people Tata hires for its customer care, without checking my ticket history or any attachments, the new person starts asking for the bank statement again. I asked to speak to a senior official, who promised me they will keep the connection active till this issue is resolved. \\nThird time again a new person calls and asks to send the bank statement to a particular email ID. I remind them that it has been done. The response is, 'but we cannot find that email Sir, can you please send it again'. I go back to my sent items locate the email and share the timestamp when it was sent. Repeat this exercise several times. I am sure chimps would learn how to use a ticketing system faster than these incompetent fools. The language and insensitivity of customer care is beyond unprofessional. This one lady pleads me to send the statement again in a tone like 'pleeease Sir Pleeeeease, ek baar bhejo na' im like wtf who talks like that.  \\n\\nToday my connection has been disconnected, I have dealt with them for nearly ten days and I am not sure what to do. I reached out to the Appellate mentioned on their website only to receive a generic response stating that the query is still open so we cannot do anything at the moment. We will get back to you after. \\n\\nI cant even request cancellation because they have me as a defaulter in their system. This is hilarious. \\n\\nSo looking up online what my options are, I guess next step is to send them a legal notice with all my proof attached. I am not sure how to go about this. Should I get a Lawyer? And is it even worth it? Just lost as to what the end goal is here because I feel defeated battling this system of incompetent fools. \\n\\nIf there are any lawyers or someone who has been through something similar, I would like to hear what options i have.\\n\\nHere is  [my statement snapshot redacted](https://imgur.com/a/LfBlSR6).

While there can be an array of reasons behind the worrying phenomenon, one of the reasons I know is the miserable quality of education particularly in the government schools and the carelessness of the teachers. In many cases, the teachers appoint a proxy teacher in their place and they themselves do other works. At the end of the month, they draw the salaries, pay a part of it to the proxy teachers and carry on. Many a time, the syllabuses don't get completed at the end of the year and the students suffer. There had even been cases when the students refused to sit in examinations because the syllabus wasn't completed.\\n\\nThose who can afford private teachers somehow manage, but many, particularly in the remote areas of the mountainous state cannot afford a private teacher or a good teacher. Once they fail in a class, they discontinue the studies. This is one factor that I want to work on and bring a change.\\n\\nI want to develop a platform where the students can get good private teachers online at a minimal cost of INR 30 per month or free. I have everything planned and want to focus firstly on Class 9 and 10 and I need a little help from your side. Since I plan to depend on volunteers and freelancers in the beginning, I will be needing a few equipment and I don't have the resource to buy them all. So, if you have what I need and you wish to donate, please do. Here are the things I am looking for:\\n\\n1. Old cameras or cellphones with good enough camera quality to record videos.\\n2. Microphones to record voice.\\n3. Flexible mobile phone holders.\\n4. LED table lights.\\n\\nWe are also open to monetary donations. Please feel free to DM me for details and other queries.\",\n",
